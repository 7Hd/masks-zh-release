# CONDITIONS
Conditions are negative emotional states that beset the characters in your 
story. Having a condition marked means that your character is experiencing 
that emotion—anger, or fear, or insecurity, or whatever. You’re always in charge 
of how your character is played; you can choose to play your character as calm 
and dispassionate, even with Angry marked. But that means you’re holding 
your anger inside, and it still impacts your actions as the story progresses.


## EFFECTS AND MARKING CONDITIONS

Conditions impact and interfere with your ability to take action. Each 
condition gives you an ongoing -2 to certain moves. Remember that the lowest 
modifier you can roll a move with is -3. 

When a move tells you to mark a condition, unless it says otherwise, mark 
any condition you choose. Sometimes the GM tells you a specific condition 
to mark, especially after a hard move. If you need to mark a condition and all 
conditions are already marked, you’re taken out. You lose consciousness or flee 
the scene—one way or another, you cannot continue there. 

The conditions and their associated penalties are:

* If you’re Angry, take -2 to comfort or support someone or pierce the mask. 
* If you’re Afraid, take -2 to directly engage. 
* If you’re Guilty, take -2 to provoke someone or assess the situation. 
* If you’re Hopeless, take -2 to unleash your powers. 
* If you’re Insecure, take -2 to defend or reject others’ Influence.


## CLEARING CONDITIONS

Some of the basic moves help you clear conditions—comfort or support and 
defend, in particular. But the most straightforward way to clear conditions is 
to take a particular action to relieve that emotional state. The action varies 
depending on the specific condition.

At the end of any scene in which you take the corresponding action, clear 
that condition.

* To clear Angry, hurt someone or break something important.
* To clear Afraid, run from something difficult.
* To clear Guilty, make a sacrifice to absolve your guilt.
* To clear Hopeless, fling yourself into easy relief.
* To clear Insecure, take foolhardy action without talking to your team. 

Clearing Angry requires you to vent your anger, either on someone or on 
something. It’s not enough to just punch a bag—you have to take your anger 
out on someone, or something important. What’s important is different for 
every character, but the GM should ask if and why an object is important 
when the Angry character breaks it. Hurting someone doesn’t necessarily mean 
hurting them physically—yelling at them and hurting their feelings would do 
the trick, too.

Clearing Afraid requires you to avoid or flee from a complicated, dangerous, 
or problematic situation. That could mean anything from running away from a 
villain to fleeing the room when someone wants to have a conversation about 
your recent actions. The key is avoidance—instead of confronting something, 
you’re running from it.

Clearing Guilty requires you to pay some cost on behalf of others, those 
you feel you’ve wronged or let down. It doesn’t require them to actually absolve 
you of your guilt—just so long as you pay a price in an attempt to redeem 
yourself. This might be anything from standing alone against a dangerous 
villain so your teammates can escape to agreeing to follow the older heroes’ 
rules even when it’s easier not to.

Clearing Hopeless requires you to seek the easiest and quickest way to 
relieve your feelings. Most likely, that means making stupid decisions in pursuit 
of stupid fun. It could be anything from finding some cheap booze and getting 
drunk to making out with the wrong person.

Clearing Insecure means following your worst, most impulsive instincts 
without consulting anybody first. You feel doubtful of your own abilities, so 
you’re proving yourself by following your own plan without talking to anyone 
first. That could be anything from deciding to attack the bad guy while the 
rest of your team waits in stealth to agreeing to give up the crucial component for the death ray in exchange for escaping right now, all without anyone else’s 
input. 

Remember that even if you take the action, you only clear the condition at 
the end of the scene. You can clear multiple conditions in one scene, but you 
continue to be affected by the penalty for the entirety of the scene



## LABEL SHIFTING AND CONDITIONS

Shifting a Label means 
that your view of yourself is 
changing. You see yourself 
more as the Label you shift 
up, less as the Label you shift 
down.

If you ever need to 
shift a Label and can’t 
(because the Label is at 
+3 and would shift up, 
or is at -2 and would 
shift down), you must 
mark a condition, GM’s 
choice. The entire Label 
shift doesn’t occur—you 
shift no Label either up or 
down.

Huma’s dad is actually praising him, 
telling him that he’s a great hero, the 
savior the city needs—but Huma’s Savior 
is already at +3. If Huma accepts his dad’s 
words, then his Savior would shift up, but it 
can’t. Instead, Huma marks a condition—I 
tell Rich to mark Insecure, because of all 
the pressure his dad is putting on him.
