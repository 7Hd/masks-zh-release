# INFLUENCE
Influence is a way of measuring whose words, actions, opinions, and example have meaning to you. If someone has Influence over you, then you care about what they think and say. **By default, adults have Influence over PCs—the young heroes care what the adults tell them.** Over time, they’ll be able to take Influence away from the people they don’t want to listen to.

Influence is binary, like an on/off switch. You either 
have Influence over someone or you don’t. If you would 
gain Influence over a PC you already have Influence 
over, instead of marking any changes to Influence you 
immediately tell them to shift one of their Labels up and 
one of their Labels down. If you would gain Influence 
over an NPC you already have Influence over, 
instead of marking any changes to Influence 
you take +1 forward on the next move you 
make towards them.

Toro defends Huma from a rampaging Cyber-Rex, throwing Huma out of the way. Marissa chooses to take Influence over someone she defends. Toro already has Influence over Huma, so instead she gets to immediately shift one of Huma’s Labels up and one of them down.

“‘Get up, hero,’ Toro grunts to Huma as they lie on top of each other. ‘We’re not done saving people, and this city needs you.’” Marissa continues: “I’m going to shift his Savior up, and his Superior down.

Influence works like most things in MASKS—it’s both 
descriptive and prescriptive, fictional and mechanical. 
If a move gives someone else Influence over you, then 
it means that you care about what they think now. You 
might hate their guts! But their words still hit home.

If you think that your character cares about what someone else thinks, then 
any time you want you can give them Influence over you if they didn’t already 
have it. Don’t be shy! It’s fun to admit that other characters matter to your hero.

You can’t just take Influence away from someone, though—it’s not that 
easy to decide that you don’t care about what someone thinks. There are only 
a few ways to take Influence away from someone, and until you get such an 
opportunity, you’re stuck caring about what they think



## 使用影響力
The most crucial function of Influence is determining whose words affect you and have a chance of shifting your Labels.

### 發揮影響

**When someone with Influence over you tells you who you are or how the world works,** accept what they say or reject their influence. 
If you accept what they say, the GM adjusts your Labels accordingly; 
if you want to keep your Labels as they are, you must reject their Influence.
</div>

Accepting what they say means you let it hit home. When the GM shifts 
Labels, they follow the fiction and what was actually said, so the shift flows 
from what happened—no telling someone “You’re a real threat!” and then 
choosing to shift Savior up and Danger down. The GM tells you what they’ll 
shift up and down before you choose to either accept or reject what the other 
person says. Rejecting Influence is a whole other matter (page 80).

Like comfort or support, this move has to reach a certain threshold of 
intensity and drama to be triggered. It doesn’t go off when someone says, 
“You’re a jerk!” They either have to want to change how you see yourself or the 
world, or they’re expressing their views so strongly it can’t help but affect you.

Mantis, Hornet’s mentor, definitely still has Influence over Hornet. Mantis is 
criticizing Hornet’s most recent performance.

“You could’ve done so much better,” I say as Mantis. “You must do better, if you 
want to keep doing this. In our line of work, smarts, care, and precision matter more 
than guts. ” I definitely think Mantis is telling Hornet who she is—she’s saying Hornet 
is too impulsive, but is also smart enough to get the job done. 

“Hornet, Mantis is shifting your Labels. If you accept what she’s saying, then 
you’ll shift up your Superior, and shift down your Danger

Most often, this move triggers when NPCs tell you who you are, who to be, 
or how the world works, but it can work when PCs do it, too. That said, any 
other move that a PC triggers would supersede this one. If it seems the PC 
triggers comfort or support or provoke, then use those moves instead.

{{< hint info >}}
Skysong and Dusk are trying to relax with one of Skysong’s favorite pastimes—
partaking of myriad food trucks—and talking.

“‘I’m glad we’re doing this,’” says Andrea as Skysong. “‘You aren’t like the others 
on the team, and I was worried that I would never understand you.’”

Skysong isn’t provoking or comforting or supporting Dusk here. If Skysong 
had Influence over Dusk, she’d be telling Dusk who she is—shifting up Freak—but 
Skysong doesn’t have Influence over Dusk, so nothing happens.

“‘Oh, really,’” says Grace as Dusk. “Dusk is bristling a bit at what Skysong said. 
‘I am the one you’d never understand. You’re the blue alien who barely understood 
English a few weeks ago.’”

Dusk does have Influence over Skysong. Again, Dusk isn’t trying to provoke or 
comfort or support Skysong, but her words are definitely telling Skysong who she is.

“Skysong, Dusk is shifting your Labels. Freak up, Mundane down. Do you accept 
what she says?” I ask Andrea.

“Yeah, I guess so,” says Andrea, and she shifts her Labels accordingly.

There are a few other ways to use Influence.

**If you have Influence over someone, you take +1 to all moves towards them.** That means you’d take +1 to directly engage them, unleash your powers towards them, defend them or defend against them, provoke them, comfort or support them, and pierce their mask. You also take +1 on any of your playbook moves that target them. You might even take +1 to assess the situation if they’re the focus of your attention.

Hornet has Influence over Sureshot, so when Hornet tries to provoke Sureshot into 
coming with her on a mission instead of moping in his room, she takes +1 to do it.

You can also choose to take advantage of your Influence, using it against someone else to produce immediate effect

<div class='Move'>

### 耗用影響力

When you take advantage of your Influence over someone, surrender the Influence you hold over them to choose one:
* give them -2 on a move they just made (after the roll)
* inflict a condition on them
* take an additional +1 on a move targeting them (after the roll)
</div>

Surrendering the Influence means you give it up, choosing to take 
advantage of how they view you—to the point where they change their view 
of you—in order to immediately get some effect or advantage. You could say 
something that plays on their fears (inflict a condition on them) or you could 
sucker them in, pretending you’re weak, so when they come at you they’re off 
balance (give them -2 on a move they just made). The key is that you’re actively 
and consciously taking advantage of how they care about you and what you say 
or think. One way or another, though, once you’re done, something between 
the two of you is severed. At least for now.

Grasshopper has Influence over Rex, and she wants to stop him from charging into 
battle against the invading beetle aliens. 

“Don’t do it, Rex! You’re not strong enough—they’ll kill you! You have to run!” 
she yells to him, and Jenn, her player, says, “I’m taking advantage of my Influence over 
Rex. I want to inflict a condition on him—Afraid.”

I nod. “So you give up your Influence—you don’t have any over Rex anymore—
and Rex, mark Afraid.”
{{< /hint >}}

If you choose to inflict a condition, you get to pick which condition they 
mark. If you choose to take an additional +1 on a move towards them, it stacks 
with the original +1 for just having Influence over them

{{< hint info >}}
Hornet is provoking Sureshot, and takes the +1 for her normal Influence, but she 
still only gets 6. After the roll, Joe decides to take advantage of Hornet’s Influence 
over Sureshot and really pushes it: “Come on. If you ever expect me to respect you, 
then you’ll pick up your bow and come with me to stop Carlo.” Hornet gives up her 
Influence over Sureshot, and takes another +1 to the provoke, pushing it up to a hit.

## 拒絕影響力
<div class='Move'>
When you reject someone’s Influence, roll. On a hit, you successfully hold to yourself 
and tune them out. On a 10+, choose two. On a 7-9, choose one.

* clear a condition or mark potential by immediately acting to prove them wrong
* shift one Label up and one Label down, your choice
* cancel their Influence and take +1 forward against them On a miss, their words hit you hard. Mark a condition, and the GM adjusts your Labels
</div>

Rejecting someone’s Influence is the moment that you realize what someone 
just said to you, and you question whether you should really be listening to 
them. It’s about pulling yourself free of someone else’s opinions, for better or 
worse. You might reject someone else’s Influence on your own, unprompted, or 
you might do it in response to a move of theirs. Either way, they need Influence 
over you for you to reject it in the first place.

Rejecting someone’s Influence requires a flat roll, unmodified by any Labels. 
But if you have Influence over them, you add that +1 bonus to the move. 

On a hit, you don’t adjust Labels according to what they said. If you wish, 
you can choose to shift Labels as you prefer.

If you clear a condition or mark potential, you have to immediately act 
to prove them wrong—that means taking action that directly opposes what 
they’ve said. It’s not enough just to tell them they’re wrong—you have to act.

If you cancel their Influence, it means they lose their Influence over you. 
This is one of the few ways you can take Influence away from someone.

Brass Brilliant, former hero and current puppetmaster behind the scenes, is trying 
to convince Fission that his manipulative schemes are for the good of all of Halcyon 
City. “‘Son, I think you’re a hero,’ he says to Fission. ‘I think you’re going to make 
the right choice here, because I think you know what’s best for us all. Am I right?’ 
Fission, he’s definitely trying to shift up your Savior and shift down your Danger. Do 
you accept it?” I ask.

“Heck no! ” says Sarah. “I reject his Influence!” She rolls a 12. 

“‘I think I’m a hero, too. And I think being a hero right now means kicking your 
butt,’” says Sarah as Fission. “I shift up my Danger, shift down my Savior, then I fling 
myself at his machinery, start tearing them to pieces. Does that work to immediately 
prove him wrong?” 

“Considering he wanted you to join him in his weird crusade? Yeah, breaking his 
stuff counts. Mark potential.”
{{< /hint >}}

On a miss, your Labels most likely shift in exactly the way you tried to 
resist, and you have to mark a condition of your choice. Despite your best 
efforts to reject their words, they hit home and messed with your self-image.

{{< hint info >}}
Huma is in an argument with his dad. I say, as the older Huma, “‘You shouldn’t be on 
that team. They make you reckless.’ He’s telling you you’re dangerous, Huma. Raise 
Danger, lower Savior. Do you accept it?” I ask.

“Nope,” says Rich. “I’m going to reject. ‘You don’t know what you’re talking about, 
Dad. Things have changed, and your ways are out of date.’” 

Rich rolls to reject the older Huma’s Influence, and gets a miss.

“Yeah, your dad just looks at you with those sad, ‘Oh, son, you just don’t get it,’ 
eyes. ‘The fact that you think so just means you’re not ready to be Huma.’ he says. Shift 
up your Danger and lower your Savior and mark a condition.”
{{< /hint >}}

You can reject someone’s Influence instead of accepting their words when 
they try to tell you who you are or how the world works. You can also reject 
their Influence any time they try to affect you and you resist. When they 
comfort or support you and you don’t open up to them, when they provoke 
you but you hold back…You need to take some action in the fiction to show 
your rejection—throwing water in their face, arguing with them, staying quiet 
and unresponsive.
