# 基本動作
在遊玩《蒙面少俠》的過程中，每個玩家都會使用到這些基本動作，推動故事的發展。

這七個基本動作分別是：〈直面威脅〉、〈釋放你的力量〉、〈保衛某人〉、〈評估局勢〉、〈煽動某人〉、〈安慰或支持某人〉、〈揭穿面具〉。本章將提供這些動作各自的詳細說明、以及他們如何在故事中發揮作用的使用範例。

## 直面威脅

當你<b>直接與威脅交戰</b>時，擲<b>+危險</b>。

<tag>若成功</tag>，你們對彼此造成交互打擊。<br/>
<tag>擲出10+時</tag>，從下列挑選二項。<br/>
<tag>擲出7-9時</tag>，挑選一項。

* 抵抗或避開對方的攻擊
* 奪走他們身上的某物
* 為你的隊友創造一個機會
* 讓對手恐懼、吃驚、或留下深刻印象
</div>
{{< details title="〈直面威脅〉詳述" >}}
〈直面威脅〉是一個用來直接與某樣東西──怪物或反派之類──戰鬥的動作。如果你只是伺機打帶跑，希望藉此讓敵人精疲力盡的話，那麼你就不是在直接與威脅交戰，也因此不會觸發這個動作。如果你是在對抗某個對你來說不怎麼危險的人或物，那麼它不會被視作威脅，這個動作也就當然不會被觸發。

「對彼此造成交互打擊」意味著你和威脅都對彼此造成了有效的攻擊。這可能會導致敘事發生變化──除非你的軀體刀槍不入，否則被一頭巨大怪物給打中很可能會讓你傷痕累累。而除了敘事之外的影響，這也通常意味著雙方標記狀態、或是觸發〈承受沉重打擊〉這個動作。

當你與NPC威脅互相造成交互打擊時，GM會標記NPC的其中一個狀態，並要求你為你的角色直接標記一個狀態、或是擲骰進行〈承受沉重打擊〉動作，取決於敘事情境。GM可以自行選擇要為NPC標記哪一個狀態。如果GM要求你進行〈承受沉重打擊〉動作，那麼你只需要遵循這個動作的規則描述來決定接下來發生什麼事就好；如果GM要求你標記一個狀態，那麼他也會接著告訴你該標記哪一個狀態。

當你與PC威脅互相造成交互打擊時，你們雙方都得擲骰進行〈承受沉重打擊〉動作。

#### 關於〈直面威脅〉的選項
**抵抗或避開對方的攻擊** 意味著你不會受到對方打擊的影響──也許你躲開了威脅的攻擊、或是你滿不在乎的接下了它，看哪種情況對你的角色和威脅來說比較合理。這個選項能確保你毫髮無傷地挺過難關，但不會給你帶來其他好處──這代表你僅僅是擊中了威脅、並很可能只讓他標記了一個狀態而已。

**奪走他們身上的某物** 意味著你可以從威脅身上奪走某個物理上或概念上的東西。舉例來說，你可以狠揍一拳讓威脅鬆手，打掉他們手上的末日死光槍；或者，你可以奪走他們的立足點讓他們跌倒在地，給你一個絕佳的逃跑機會；又或者，你可以奪走他們的站位，讓他們不再位於超光速粒子大砲的控制面板前方。這個選項給你一個大好機會去透過攻擊來改變敵我局勢。

**為你的隊友創造一個機會** 意味著你為你的隊友（或者其他盟友）創造出了一個行動的機會、或取得某種優勢。也許你把反派檔在一邊，你的隊友因此有機會衝過去阻截微中子炸彈的啟動。或許你狠狠猛擊惡棍，讓他直直飛向了你在空中的隊友，讓他們有機會接一套漂亮的連續技。無論如何，這個選項都能讓團隊戰術得以實現。

有時候，你會選擇這個選項來改變實際的局勢，讓你的隊友能因此逮到機會去做某個他們原本做不到的事情；而有時候，這個選項就只是為你隊友提供助力。前者的話，選擇這個選項將讓你的隊友獲得採取該行動的機會。若情況為後者，那麼你們將因此獲得一點 **團隊默契**（參見 團隊默契 章節）。GM會告訴你當時的情境是哪一種。

**讓對手恐懼、吃驚、或留下深刻印象** 意味著你在交互造成打擊後影響了威脅對你的看法。也許在你展現出如此強大的力量後，他們會突然對你另眼相看；又或許你以一種他們前所未見的方式證明了自己的危險，而他們將因此試圖從你身邊逃離。當你在面對NPC威脅時選擇了這個選項，GM將從這些選項中（恐懼、吃驚、或留下深刻印象）挑選最合理的反應。而無論是NPC或PC，GM可能也會為其標記一個狀態以反映該角色的新看法，只要這個發展符合敘事即可。

「蠻牛」多羅（由瑪莉莎扮演）在上一次的慘敗後被抓到了這個秘密實驗室，而她現在正嘗試著從中逃脫。在她逃跑的過程中，她遇到了一個跟她極為相似的超人類實驗體；她的克隆體，烏爾莎。烏爾莎露出了殘酷的笑容，讓金屬利爪唰的一聲從她的指尖伸出──這個加強版的能力是多羅所沒有的。瑪莉莎說多羅向旁啐了一口作為回應，並接著舉起雙拳，衝向烏爾莎打算把她狠狠痛揍一番。

在這個情境下，多羅很顯然是在直接與威脅交戰，因此我要求瑪莉莎擲骰進行〈直面威脅〉動作。她擲+危險，並得到了 8 的結果：她和烏爾莎對彼此造成交互打擊，且只能選擇一個選項。瑪莉莎選擇了「奪走烏爾莎身上的某物」──在這個情境下，也就是烏爾莎的金屬利爪。我向瑪莉莎詢問多羅是怎麼做到這件事的，她便描述道多羅抓住了烏爾莎的雙手，將其狠狠砸進牆中，因而折斷了她的利爪。這聽起來很讚！但在這件事發生之前，烏爾莎的金屬利爪會先一步在多羅身上留下幾道可怖的爪痕，而且就連多羅那超級堅硬的肌膚都無法擋下這道爪擊──我要求瑪莉莎為多羅擲骰進行〈承受沉重打擊〉動作，且我給烏爾莎標記了一個狀態（我認為「憤怒」是個很適合的狀態）。

「異變者」雷克斯（由麥特扮演）闖入了征服者的侵攻機獸的操控艙──這頭跟摩天大樓一樣巨大的機器人正在神翠市街道上瘋狂肆虐。雷克斯的視線掃過整個控制艙，裏面滿滿都是征服者的手下，一群實力遠遠不及那位外星大帝的外星雜魚。

「我要衝進去，然後把他們一個個丟飛出去，我需要骰〈直面威脅〉嗎？」麥特問道。

「不用，」我說：「他們不是你的對手，所以不算什麼威脅。你輕而易舉地把他們全都丟飛了出去，並完全癱瘓了侵攻機獸的控制。然而，你也在此時聽見征服者的聲音從控制艙的入口傳來……」

## 釋放你的力量

當你<b>釋放你的力量</b>克服阻礙、重塑環境、或延展感官時，擲<b>+古怪</b>。

<tag>若成功</tag>，你成功達成目的。<br/>
<tag>擲出7-9時</tag>，你標記一個狀態、或者ＧＭ會告訴你這股力量是多麼不穩定或僅只造成暫時性的影響。
</div>
{{< details title="〈釋放你的力量〉詳述" >}}
Unleashing  your  powers  is  the  move  for  doing  something  complicated, 
dangerous, and difficult with your powers. It is  definitely  not the “use your 
powers” move—you’re probably using your abilities on nearly all of the basic 
moves. This move is for those situations when you do something intense with 
your powers, and we’re not sure how it’ll go, or if you can even pull it off.

This distinction is crucial—just using your abilities isn’t unleashing them. 
Unleashing them means pushing them or using them in dangerous or difficult 
situations. Over the course of the game you’ll establish a baseline for each 
character that tells you when it feels like they’re unleashing and when they 
aren’t. And keep in mind, these characters are all young superheroes, getting 
the hang of their powers and what they can do—chances are, they unleash 
their powers and push the boundaries of what they can do more often than not.

If you aren’t trying to overcome an obstacle, reshape your environment, 
or extend your senses, then you’re probably not unleashing your powers. That 
said, these categories are pretty open-ended. Overcoming an obstacle covers 
both flying faster than the villainous Speed Demon to get to the artifact first 
and smashing through the sorcerous energy field Gehenna cast to keep you 
away from her sanctum. Reshaping your environment covers both bringing 
down one wall of the building so you can escape and using your magnetic 
powers to trap the villain inside a cage of steel. Extending your senses covers 
both extending your telepathy into someone’s mind and using your super-
vision to see halfway across the city. 

Unleash your powers is a bit of an overarching move. When you’re trying 
to punch out a titanic rock monster, it feels like you’re unleashing your powers, 
namely your tremendous strength...except, that’s a move to directly engage 
a threat. When you’re trying to create a massive ice wall to save your friends 
from an explosion, it feels like you’re unleashing your powers...except, that’s 
a move to defend someone from an immediate threat. Always see if another 
move fits better and more specifically  than unleash your powers before using 

this move—it’s really here for situations where the other moves don’t fit. 
If the characters are just using their regular abilities to solve a problem—
running from a threat with no special powers, for example, or trying to drive 
a car into an enemy—then it’s not unleashing your powers. The GM just says 
what happens based on the fiction. If you want to try to take control over what 
happens, use your powers to solve problems!

#### 關於〈釋放你的力量〉的選項
On a hit, you do it means that as long as you roll 7 or higher, you do the thing 
you set out to do, no matter what. But on a 7-9, you have to choose to either 
mark a condition (of your choice, not the GM’s), or let the GM tell you how 
your effect is unstable or temporary.

Temporary is pretty self-explanatory—it puts a time pressure on the effect, 
and it could be anything from, “You’ve wrapped the villain in a metal cage, 
but he’s gonna break out soon, you’ve only bought yourself a bit of time,” to 
“You’ve managed to lift up the debris of the collapsed building with your 
gravity powers, but you can only hold it up for a bit longer.” 

Unstable is about unintended additional consequences, often dangerous to 
you or others. Unstable effects never take away from the core success of the 
roll—you still did whatever you intended to do. But they add an additional 
element  that  complicates  the  situation:  collateral  damage,  unintended 
consequence, or worse. The GM might even make you roll to take a powerful 
blow as a result of an unstable effect.

Sarah is playing Fission the Nova, who’s currently stuck in a nuclear reactor that was 
damaged in an attack by Helldrake; it’s about to overload and detonate half the city. 
Sarah says, “I suck in all the radiation and nuclear force, then I want to fire it up into 
the sky in a single beam of light!” I grin, both because that’s awesome, and because 
I’m excited to find out if this works. This is absolutely Fission pushing his powers to 
the limit and reshaping the environment by pulling away all that radiation, so I ask 
Sarah to roll to unleash Fission’s powers. Sarah gets a big ol’ 13. Fission successfully 
siphons it all off and shoots it into the sky!

Mark is playing Sureshot the Beacon, whose abilities are acrobatics and his bow and 
trick arrows. Sureshot is trying to get into the thick of the action below from his 
perch atop a nearby building—he wants duke it out with the VENOM goons on the 
ground. Mark says, “Sureshot fires an arrow with a long tether attached to the end 
of it, then uses that to zipline his way to the ground. So that’s probably unleashing 
his powers, right?”

“Nah,” I say. “You’re not looking for pinpoint accuracy here, and no one’s focusing 
on you right this second. It’s not too difficult for you to do, and you get down to the 
ground without any issue. But as soon as you do, some VENOM goons notice you 
and swarm over. What do you do?”

{{< details title="〈保衛某人〉詳述" >}}
Defending  someone  is  the  move  you  use  to  stop  something  bad  from 
happening. It’s not about preemptively preparing a defense, or setting up a 
shield—it’s about preventing the worst in the moment. The threat must be 
immediate for this move to trigger. 

NPC threats include threats from the environment—anything the GM 
describes or controls. Defending someone from a PC threat is for when a 
fellow PC tries to do something bad and you try to stop them. The key isn’t that 
you’re defending another PC—it’s that you’re defending against another PC.

When you trigger this move, be sure that both you and the GM are clear on 
what the immediate threat is. You can defend someone from physical dangers 
and threats, but you can also defend someone from cruel words or insults—if 
an older hero berates your teammate, you can defend them just as much as if 
a fireball was hurtling towards their face. In this case, the immediate threat is 
the harm and effects of the words.

You don’t trigger defend someone when you’re trying to keep yourself safe 
from an NPC or environmental threat—that’s much more likely to be another 
move, like unleashing your powers, or rejecting their Influence. You can defend 
yourself from a PC threat when another PC tries to hurt you.

Keeping them safe means that you prevent the danger you acted against. If 
you’re putting up an energy shield to stop someone from getting roasted, then 
on a hit, you do that—they’re protected from the flame blast. 

On a 7-9, you must expose yourself to danger or escalate the situation—
your choice. Exposing yourself to danger leaves the danger up to the GM. 
It  could  mean  anything  from  you  taking  the  hit  instead  of  whomever 
you’re defending, to your actions leaving you in a more vulnerable position. 
Escalating the situation means you make things more tense, more dangerous, 
more complicated in general. This is you breaking out your powers to defend 
someone when a moment before it was just a verbal fight. 

When you defend against a PC threat, it should always be when the PC is 
making a move and they’re really being an overt threat towards you. On a hit, 
you give them -2 to their roll, which might shift them down to a 7-9 result or 
even a miss. If their move becomes a miss, they still mark potential and the GM 
makes a hard move, as usual. They can also still get boosts by other teammates 
spending Team out of the pool (page 48). 

Getting a 10+ when defending against a PC threat means you just give 
them -2 to their roll at no cost. Getting a 7-9 means you expose yourself to cost, 
retribution, or judgment—GM’s choice, based on the situation. Cost means you 
pay a price, usually marking a condition yourself, to defend against the other 
PC. Retribution means the other PC gets a chance to act against you without 
your  interference.  Judgment  means  other 
people  watching  might  judge 
you for your actions, leading 
them  to  shift  your  Labels 
(page 44) or otherwise act 
against you. 

#### 關於〈保衛某人〉的選項
On a hit when defending against 
an  NPC  threat,  you  always  get  to 
choose  one  option  from  the  list. 
Adding a Team to the pool means your 
actions now are building up a sense of 
team cohesion and focus that you can 
call on later. 

Taking Influence  over someone 
you protect means they care about 
how you’ve helped them, and 
they’re more inclined to listen to 
you moving forward. If you already 
had Influence over an NPC, there’s 
little reason to take Influence over them 
again—you’ll get +1 forward on your 
next move aimed at them, but that’s it.

However, taking Influence over a PC 
you already hold it over allows you to 
immediately  shift  their  Labels. When 
you protect a whole bunch of people, 
you  can  either:  name  the  specific 
person  in  the  crowd  that  you  want 
Influence over; let the GM tell you someone important in the crowd over 
whom you now have Influence; or take Influence over a whole group.

Clearing a condition means you can immediately clear a condition you have 
marked, before you suffer any consequences for defending someone.

In the midst of an intense superhero brawl, Grasshopper the Janus, played by Jenn, 
and Sureshot the Beacon, played by Mark, are facing down the obnoxious Troll. 
Sureshot’s been hurt, so he’s trying to pick himself up while Grasshopper rushes in 
to help. At the same moment, Troll flips a car straight at Sureshot. 

“Aaa! I flip in quickly and grab Sureshot so I can pull him out of the way!” Jenn says. 

I tell Jenn to roll to defend Sureshot. She gets 9, then picks one from the list. 
“Definitely adding one Team to the pool. I just saved Sureshot’s butt!”

I nod. “Yeah you did! But now you have to either escalate the situation or expose 
yourself to danger, your choice.”

Jenn thinks. “Well, I’m not really escalating right now. If I was super strong, I 
could escalate by kicking the car back at Troll...but I’m not, so I can’t. Yeah, I guess I 
just expose myself to danger.”

“Yep, that sounds right to me, too,” I say. “I think you get Sureshot out of the way, 
but you get clipped by the car. Roll to take a powerful blow.”

Dominus, a terrifyingly powerful metahuman, floats over Halcyon City Square, 
reshaping the buildings into statues to his glory. Dusk the Doomed uses her dark 
portal to teleport into the area, just in time to see people getting flung from the 
buildings as Dominus reshapes them. 

“Aw, crud. All right, I’ll create a big scoop with my shadow powers: I want to catch 
those people,” Grace, who’s playing Dusk, says.

“Excellent! Roll to defend. The threat is that the people aren’t caught in time.”

Grace rolls a 10! She gets to choose one option from the list. She doesn’t have any 
conditions, and she feels weird about adding a Team to the pool when no one else 
is around, so she chooses to take Influence on someone she saves. “But I don’t know 
who’s in this clump of people,” she says.

“That’s okay, I’ve got a great idea! You create your shadow scoop and catch them 
as they fall. You safely deposit the people on the ground again, and you think you 
spy—is that Grasshopper’s mom? What’s she doing here? Well, regardless, she sees 
you and the look of gratitude on her face speaks volumes—take Influence over her. 
But Dominus has noticed you—he’s floating over in your direction. What do you do?”

## 評估局勢

當你評估局勢，擲<b>+優越</b>。

<tag>擲出10+時</tag>，詢問二項。<br/>
<tag>擲出7-9時</tag>，詢問一項。<br/>
你在依據問題的回答行動時將獲得+1加值。

* 這裡有什麼可以讓我用來_____？
* 這裡最大的威脅是什麼？
* 這裡什麼正處於最大的危險之中？
* 這裡有誰對我來說是最脆弱的？
* 我們怎樣才能最快的結束這一切？
</div>
{{< details title="〈評估局勢〉詳述" >}}
Assess  the  situation  is  the  move  for  when  you  want  to  get  specific  and 
useful information about your situation and surroundings. In the fiction, this 
is you taking a moment to survey what’s going on around you, looking for 
important details. You can always ask the GM clarifying questions about your 
environment and what your character would know—assessing the situation is 
for highly specific and pointed information.

As long as you’re using the information you learned from your assessment 
to guide your actions, take +1 to your moves and rolls. But if the situation 
changes too much, you might not get that bonus anymore. If you can take a 
course of action that uses multiple answers, the bonuses stack, but remember 
you can never roll with more than +4 total, including your Label.

#### 關於〈評估局勢〉的選項
“What here can I use to _____?” lets you fill in the blank when you ask the 
question. This is a great question for finding useful tools and pieces of your 
surroundings  that  will  help  you  accomplish  some  purpose. Want  to  trap 
Vanquish? Ask “What here can I use to trap Vanquish?” and the GM will tell 
you. The answer might be “nothing.” 

“What here is the biggest threat?” helps you to prioritize dangers and threats 
in the area. You can clarify to the GM how you prioritize things yourself—so 
the GM knows whether you’d think that the biggest threat is an enemy or 
something that endangers civilians, for instance. It’s also useful even when 
you’re not in an immediately dangerous situation to find out who’s the most 
menacing in the room. 

“What here is in the greatest danger?” is the inverse of the prior question. 
This tells you what needs protection the most, and potentially alerts you to the 
target or focus of a villain’s attention—if they’re after someone or something, 
chances are it’ll be in the greatest danger. 

“Who here is most vulnerable to me?” is about your own abilities and whom 
they can best affect. The obvious answers focus on who’s most vulnerable to 
your particular skills and abilities, but it can also take into account who’s most 
vulnerable to your words, if someone‘s susceptible to the things you could say. 

“How could we best end this quickly?” outlines a course of action to stop a 
dangerous or bad situation as quickly as possible. This could be how best to take 
down an enemy quickly, but it might tell you that the best way to end things 
quickly is to flee. It might also tell you that all you have to do is apologize to 
bring a bad situation to a close.

Hornet’s been captured by dark cultists working for Lady Faust. She’s being held in 
some hidden basement. One of the first things she does upon waking is assess the

“What here can I use to escape?” Joe asks.

“Looking more closely at the room, you realize you’re locked into some kind of 
old cell. The bars are wrought iron, but one looks a bit loose. If you can kick that bar 
out, you can use it as a pry bar to bend out the others. But doing that’s gonna be hard, 
especially if you want to avoid making noise. What do you do?”

“I’m gonna go for it. Kick out the bar and use it to pry open the others,” Joe says.

After hearing about it on the news, Skysong flew to Halcyon’s Pristine Park and hid 
herself among some trees where she could watch an alien spaceship that landed 
in the park, with alien cyborgs marching down its landing ramp. She assesses the 
situation from the safety of her tree and gets a 10. She can ask two questions.

“Hm. I think I know what the biggest threat is...how about, what here is in the 
greatest danger?” Andrea, Skysong’s player, asks.

“You watch them pull big weapons on anti-gravity platforms out of their ship. 
You’re an alien, so you recognize these cannons—they’re called Archon Rays, and 
they’re most famous for neutralizing mutational or extranormal powers. So it’s other 
supers of Earth who are in the greatest danger,” I reply. 

She asks, “Okay, how can I best end this quickly?”

“Observing them more closely, you recognize the technology and the aliens 
themselves. You’ve heard of them, if you haven’t seen them up close—Menagerists, 
they’re called. They’re probably here looking for metahumans for their zoo. If you can 
convince them that the metahumans here are too tough to be worth the trouble of 
capturing, or if you can convince them that there really aren’t any valuable specimens 
here, they’ll take off. But as you’re putting all this together, they start moving towards 
the treeline and into the city. What do you do?”

Provoking someone is one of the main ways to make other characters do what 
you want. This isn’t just straight up manipulation, though—provoking someone 
isn’t about trying to convince them to do it, or offering them something they 
want. It’s about pushing the right buttons to get them to do what you want. 
Your words don’t have to match your intent, so long as you’re pressing the 
right buttons. 

You can only provoke someone susceptible to your words. If you have 
Influence over someone, they are, by default, susceptible to your words, but 
otherwise it’s down to what makes sense. Sometimes you’re able to say the right 
thing to get to someone, especially if you’ve already pierced their mask (page 
73). But other times, they can shrug off your words—for example, Rampage, 
a dangerous and powerful monster, might not be susceptible to your threats of 
violence. But if you prod and taunt her about her transformed, inhuman form, 
she might be susceptible to those words. 

When you provoke someone, tell the GM what you’re trying to get them to 
do. This is crucial! What you say in character to provoke them is about pushing 
their buttons—but what you actually want them to do might be totally different 
from what you say out loud. You might provoke an adult hero, pushing them, 
getting in their face, as if you were provoking them to a violent confrontation. 
Except you really want them to back down and leave, and you’re counting on 
them being an adult and a hero to get them to do what you actually want. Every 
time you provoke someone, you must say exactly what you want them to do 
out of character, no matter what you’re saying in character.

When an NPC “rises to the bait and does what you want,” it means they do 
whatever you said you wanted them to do out of character. If you wanted them 
to back down, they do. If you wanted them to come after you and ignore your 
teammates, they do. On a 7-9 result for NPCs, they can still choose to rise to 
the bait and do what you want, or they can instead choose one of 
the options from the list.

#### 關於〈煽動某人〉的選項
If the NPC stumbles, it means they were tripped up, caught on something, 
knocked off balance by your words. They’re ill-prepared to deal with your next 
move; hence, you get +1 forward against them. Stumbling is essentially non-
action, allowing you to follow-up with a more straightforward move against 
them, at an advantage.

If the NPC errs, it means they take action without planning or thinking 
and it leaves them vulnerable or creates an opportunity that you wouldn’t 
have otherwise had. They might take a swing at you, leaving them open for 
you to simply knock them out with one punch. They might accidentally let 
information slip in an attempt to tell you off. 

If the NPC overreacts, it means you take Influence over them, and they take 
an exaggerated or extreme reaction in response to what you say, something 
that shows you’ve really gotten to them. This isn’t the same as erring—their 
overreaction might not give you any kind of opportunity or even a chance to 
react. Instead, it shows how much your words actually affected them. They 
might start firing their eyebeams at you in response to your taunting. They 
might lose their composure and start insulting you directly. 

If you’re trying to provoke a PC, on a 7-9, you pick that either they must 
mark a condition if they don’t do what you said you wanted them to do out 
of character, or you can add a Team to the pool if they do what you want. On 
a 10+, both are true. If they must mark a condition, they get to choose which 
condition they mark.

The Dread Queen is flying in her quantum skyship, chasing Skysong over the skies of 
Halcyon City. Huma sees the fight and flies up into the skies to join them.

“I want to fly after the Dread Queen. I fire a few force blasts at her ship, not really 
to hit her, just to get her attention. I want her to focus on me,” says Rich. 

“It’s not quite enough. Her ship’s one tough cookie, and she knows she has 
Skysong on the ropes. She’s not changing course.” I’m signaling to Rich that this isn’t 
a provoke yet—the Dread Queen isn’t susceptible to Huma’s provocation attempts 
right now.

“Hmm. Okay, I’ll fly directly in front of her cockpit, sit on the glass, and smile 
down at her. As smugly as I can.” 

I smile at Rich. “Yeah, okay, sounds like that’ll get her goat. You want her to chase 
you and try to kill you, right? Ignore Skysong?” Rich nods. “Great! Then roll for it.”

Rich rolls to provoke the Dread Queen, and gets a 7. In this case, I choose to 
have her overreact.

“Okay! She rapidly brakes her ship, so you go flying off thanks to inertia, and 
then with a snarl you can see through her cockpit, she opens fire with a steady stream 
of bolts. She was holding her fire before so as not to damage Halcyon City—the 
weirdness of her legal status as a foreign official would’ve protected her if she didn’t 
actually hurt the city, so long as she only went after non-citizens, like Skysong. But 
now she’s firing at you full bore, and she doesn’t care what she hits. Take Influence 
over her, and tell me what you do now!”

The Silver Savior is lecturing Vertex about how the young hero needs to live up to 
being a real hero. Vertex blows him off and opens up with a bit of a tirade.

“‘Hey, you know what? I’m not sure why I should listen to you at all. You’re all 
covered in metallic goo, sure, but do you even have the Silver Spark anymore? Is 
that just metallic paint on your skin? Best I can tell, you haven’t done anything real 
important for a while.” Jack smiles slyly.

“Yeah, that does it. You’re provoking him, right?”

“Yep! I want him to take me on a real mission and 
show off.”

I ask Jack to roll, and he gets a 12—Silver Savior 
rises to the bait.

“‘Very well,” I say, speaking for the Silver 
Savior. “The Sable Saboteur has 
been sighted on her way 
back  to  Earth,  and 
I was going to the 
Astra One space station 
to prepare for her. You’re 
coming.”

Comforting or supporting someone is the move for helping others get over 
their conditions and take control of their own destinies. It might appear to be 
a nonessential move at first glance—which is more important, comforting or 
supporting someone, or being able to punch superhuman monsters in the face? 
But comforting or supporting is just as crucial as any other move in the game. 

Comforting  or  supporting  needs  to  break  a  certain  threshold  for  the 
move to be triggered. This isn’t for pats on the back or simple “Good job!” 
compliments. This is for genuine, open-hearted, even extended emotional 
support of another person. This is for heart-to-hearts, for meaningful gestures 
and actions. 

That said, you shouldn’t feel that there are more limits on situations when 
you can trigger comforting or supporting. You absolutely can trigger it in 
the middle of a terrible fight, just as much as you can trigger it when you’re 
hanging out at your base. As long as you’re genuinely trying to comfort or 
support someone in a meaningful fashion, you can trigger the move.

You can also comfort or support PCs and NPCs. If you comfort or 
support an NPC, their reactions largely depend on whether they have 
conditions marked. If they do, they act to clear those conditions. If they 
don’t, then it’s up to the GM whether the NPC chooses to open up in that 
moment. PCs always get to make their own decisions about opening 
up to you.

#### 關於〈安慰或支持某人〉的選項
On a hit, the person you are comforting or supporting has to 
decide if they want to open up to you. What that means varies 
heavily depending on the specific situation—it could cover 
anything from confessing a secret to returning a kiss. The 
key is that it supports a meaningful emotional, dramatic 
exchange. If you don’t feel like you’ve received any kind 
of  open-hearted  response,  then  it’s  not  enough—the 
character you supported or comforted hasn’t opened up. 

If they do open up, they get to choose to either mark 
potential, clear a condition immediately, or shift one of 
their Labels up and one of their Labels down (both their 
choice). Making the emotional connection helps them 
strengthen their self.

On a 10+, you also get to choose to either add a Team to the pool or clear 
a condition immediately yourself. You only get to do this if they open up to 
you—if they don’t open up, then no one gets anything.

Sometimes, opening up in response to comfort or support triggers another 
move, a Team move—sharing a vulnerability or weakness. If that’s the case, it’s 
fine! Finish resolving the comfort or support, then resolve the vulnerability 
or weakness.

La Espada is coming for Sureshot, ready for a fight—but Sureshot has different ideas. 

“I put away my bow, clipping it to my back,” says Mark, Sureshot’s player. “I look 
at her straight on. ‘You don’t have to do this. You could be so much better than this. 
You’re so good with that sword! You don’t have to be a criminal!’”

I’m not sure this is quite enough for her to be comforted or supported, especially 
since Sureshot doesn’t have Influence over La Espada, so I don’t say anything about 
that. “She comes closer, and now she’s within range. She pulls back the sword to 
strike at you.”

“I don’t move,” says Mark. “‘I’m not going to fight you. You can hit me again, or 
you can prove that you’re what I think you are. That you’re better than this. I really 
hope you prove me right.’”

“That’ll  do  it,”  I  say. “You’re  comforting  or  supporting  her—in  this  case, 
supporting. Roll it.”

Mark gets an 8. That means that if she opens up to him, she can clear a condition, 
mark potential, or shift Labels—but since she’s an NPC, only clearing a condition 
matters. If she had no conditions marked, it would be up to me what she does, based 
on her moves and her drive. In this case, she has Angry marked, so she’s definitely 
going to try to clear it—NPCs always do. 

“She pauses for a second, with a look of anger on her face, and there’s a moment 
where she tightens her grip...and then she puts down the sword. ‘Get out of here,’ she 
says. ‘I’ll do the same. I don’t think I’m as good as you say...but you’re right. I’m better 
than this.’” I clear her Angry condition.

Dusk and Grasshopper go to a party after a hard day’s fight. Dusk doesn’t normally 
do this, though, and she’s pretty reluctant to be here. Grasshopper is trying to talk 
her out of her solitude.

“‘Don’t separate yourself from us, Dusk. You’re one of us. We like you. Stay here, 
hang out with me, relax. Please,’” says Jenn as Grasshopper.

“Are you trying to comfort or support Dusk?” I ask Jenn.

“Definitely,” replies Jenn. 

I ask Grace, “Is that enough? Do you think what she said would mean anything 
to Dusk?” 

“Oh yeah,” says Grace. “Grasshopper has Influence over Dusk, so definitely.”

“Cool,” I say, and I ask Jenn to roll to comfort or support. She gets a 10! That 
means if Dusk opens up, Grace can choose to mark potential, clear a condition, or 
shift her Labels, and Jenn can either clear a condition or add a Team to the pool. 

“So, are you going to open up? What’s that look like?” I ask Grace.

“Yep, I think I do. I smile back at Grasshopper, and say, ‘Thank you.’” 

To Jenn, I say: “Is that enough for you? Do you feel she’s really opened up?”

“No, not quite yet,” says Jenn.

“Okay. ‘I...I haven’t really had any close friends before. And I don’t know how to 
act around them. But it means a lot for you to say that to me,’” says Grace.

“Perfect!” says Jenn, and both Grace and Jenn choose their options.

## 揭穿面具

當你揭開某人的面具以見識他的真面目時，擲<b>+平凡</b>。

<tag>擲出10+時</tag>，詢問三項。<tag>擲出7-9時</tag>，詢問一項。

* 你打算要做什麼？
* 我要怎麼樣才能讓你的角色去_____？

Pierce the mask is for seeing who someone really is, beneath whatever facade 
they present. It’s not just about literally seeing beneath someone’s mask; it’s 
about  understanding  another  person.  It  requires  you  to  watch  someone, 
observe them, pick up on their body language and their emotions, to get a 
read on who they really are. You don’t have to be talking with them to trigger 
this move, but it’s easy to say you’re trying to pierce someone’s mask when 
you’re talking to them.

When you pierce someone’s mask, you get to ask questions of them, and 
their player must answer honestly. For NPCs, that means the GM answers 
honestly. You should ask all your questions at once, but if you must, you can 
hold questions for as long as you’re watching them.

#### 關於〈揭穿面具〉的選項
“What are you really planning?” is about long term plans. It’s about overarching 
goals and intent, not immediate intent. The answer could be “Nothing,” but 
most characters have some kind of overarching goal and plan that they can 
use to answer the question.

“What do you want me to do?” puts a focus on the other person’s vision and 
ideas for you and how they want you to act. You can usually offer to act how 
they want in exchange for getting something from them. 

“What do you intend to do?” is about immediate plans, right here in the 
moment. It’s a very action-focused question, giving you information on what 
you can expect to happen very soon.

“How could I get your character to ___?” is one of your best ways to 
get other characters to do what you want in the game. You fill in the blank 
with whatever action you want them to take. They have to answer honestly, 
so whatever action or events they describe will genuinely get them to take 
the actions they’ve promised. The answer might be “You can’t,” because the 
question and what it’s asking of them is so not in character, they just wouldn’t 
do what you want them to.

“How could I gain Influence over you?” is one of the most straightforward 
ways of getting Influence on someone. If you already have Influence over 
them, the question won’t tell you anything; if you don’t, this tells you what you 
need to do to ensure that your words and opinions matter to them. If you do 
whatever they tell you to do, they should grant you Influence immediately after.

Skysong is talking to Agent Coriolis of A.E.G.I.S. Coriolis wants Skysong to hand 
over her crystalline ship, but Skysong doesn’t trust the agent.

“I want to pierce her mask,” says Andrea.

“Sure! So you’re watching her carefully, trying to read her through her carefully 
calm mask?” Andrea nods. “Roll for it,” I say.

Andrea rolls an 8. She chooses to ask, “What are you really planning?” 

“You’re right to be suspicious. She’s A.E.G.I.S., and they aren’t altruistic. You can 
see it in her eyes, the veiled excitement and greed—she wants to get her hands on 
your ship so she can take it apart and learn its technologies,” I say. “What do you do?”

The Scarlet Songbird is trying to waltz out of a bank with a few bags of cash, and Rex 
thuds to the ground in front of him, folding his arms. Songbird doesn’t even try to 
run, though—he just keeps walking.

“This is weird, even for this joker,” says Matt. “I want to pierce his mask, figure 
out what’s going on, before I decide to punch him.”

Matt rolls an 11. His first question: “What do you intend to do?”

“He’s way cockier than he should be. He intends to get out of here with the cash, 
sure, but more importantly he intends to show off by taking you down. He must think 
he has some way to do that, nice and easy.” 

“Yeah, that’s not going to happen. How could I gain Influence over him? It’d be 
useful for stopping him,” asks Matt.

“Compliment him! Play into his arrogance and ego, and he’ll start listening. 
Praise this clever plan of his,” I say.

“Ugh. I really, really don’t want to do that.”

“Well, he’s walking past you now, so what do you do?”

Taking a powerful blow is a move for when you get hit—hard. You’ll never 
trigger this one intentionally. The GM always tells you when you need to 
roll it. Most likely, you’ll get smacked during a fight—often as a result of a 
directly engage—and the GM will tell you to take a powerful blow to see what 
happens. You can take a powerful blow on an emotional level, too—getting 
punched with a deep and terrible truth, maybe, or hearing someone you care 
about utterly rip your heart to shreds.

Rolling + conditions marked means that you count up however many 
conditions you have marked, and add that number to your roll. Remember, 
you can’t roll with higher than +4. If you have zero conditions marked, then 
you roll +0. 


#### 關於〈承受沉重打擊〉的選項
You must remove yourself from the situation means you’re out. You’re knocked 
from the scene somehow. You get ultimate say in how exactly you’re removed, 
but you should follow the fiction. If you just got punched in the face, you 
probably got knocked out. You’ll come back next scene, but all your conditions 
will still be marked. 

You lose control of yourself or your powers in a terrible way means the GM 
gets to tell you how your powers go haywire, cause collateral damage, make 
the world around you unstable, and all kinds of other bad stuff. Losing control 
of yourself means that you might say or do something awful. The GM chooses 
which you do, and what exactly that looks like. 

Lashing out verbally means you’re thrown off your game, and you release 
the tension by snapping at someone you care about, usually another teammate. 
You have to immediately provoke them to take a foolhardy action, or you 
have to take advantage of your Influence over them to inflict a condition—any 
condition. Those are the only actions that satisfy “lashing out verbally.”

Giving ground means you retreat, or hold back, or otherwise leave an 
opening for your opposition. The GM decides what it is, but usually it means 
your opposition can make some move they otherwise would’ve been blocked 
from, without you being able to stop them.

Struggling past the pain means you mark two conditions of your choice. 
You hurt, but you keep going.

When you stand strong, you mark potential (just like on any miss), and you 
get to say exactly how you manage to weather or avoid the blow.

Toro’s tussling with the robotic-bodied Shell, the two powerhouses punching it out 
head-on. Marissa rolls to directly engage a threat and gets an 8, ultimately choosing 
to take something from Shell—in this case, her weapons. But that means they trade 
blows, so Shell gets a hit in on Toro before Toro rips off Shell’s gun arms.

“Toro, you’re in close with Shell, so she’s having a hard time bringing her cannon-
arms to bear, which is good for you—you may be tough, but those things hurt. You 
see an opening, but it leaves you open too. You manage to sweep past one of her 
punches to get in close and latch your hands onto her elbows, but she gets a good 
shot at your sides with her guns, before you rip off either end of her arms, wires and 
sparks spewing out of the broken limbs. Take a powerful blow for her shots,” I say 
to Marissa.

“I’ve got Angry marked, so I’m rolling +1,” says Marissa. She rolls, and gets 
a miss—a good thing on this move! She gets to mark potential and say how she 
weathers the blow.

“Oh, it hurts, a ton,” says Marissa. “But I just stand there and take it, relying on my 
invulnerability and focusing on my goals. She’s not going to stop me.”

Dusk and Vertex are facing Lady Faust, Dusk’s nemesis and ancestor, in a standoff, 
circling each other. 

“I want to provoke her into revealing a secret—telling me why she’s here,” says 
Grace. “‘If you’re so powerful, why all the subtlety? Are you worried I’ll stop you?’”

“Cool!” I say. “Go ahead and roll.” Grace gets snake eyes! 

“Oh yeah, she looks at you with a feral grin. ‘Oh, you poor child,’ she says. ‘I 
wouldn’t want to burden you further. After all that you’ve been through, all that 
you’ve done to those around you...all the suffering you caused to your parents.’ Her 
grin grows wider. ‘You did know, didn’t you? That your status as the portal to another 
realm caused your mother to go mad?’”

“Oh, man,” says Grace. “I did not know that. Oh, man.”

“Yep,” I say. “I think that means you take a powerful blow. The revelation hits 
you hard.” Grace rolls to take a powerful blow. Fortunately, she didn’t have any 
conditions marked, so she rolls +0 and gets an 8. 

“I choose to lash out at a teammate. Vertex maybe makes a movement, to come 
closer to me, and I turn and snap at him—’Get away from me! Get back! Get out of 
here!’ I’m provoking him to leave me alone with Lady Faust.”
