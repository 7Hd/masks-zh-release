Directly engaging a threat is the move for straightforwardly duking it out with 
something—a monster, a villain, whatever. If you’re playing a bit of the rope-
a-dope, hoping to tire an enemy out, you’re not directly engaging, so the move 
isn’t triggered. If you’re up against someone or something that isn’t actually all 
that dangerous to you, then they’re not a threat, and the move isn’t triggered.

Trading blows means both you and the threat get in some good hits on 
each other. That can lead to changes in the fiction—getting punched by a 
giant monster probably leaves you nice and bruised, unless you’re utterly 
invulnerable. Beyond the fiction, though, this most often means inflicting 
conditions, or triggering the move take a powerful blow. 

When you trade blows with an NPC threat, the GM marks one of the NPC’s 
conditions, and tells you whether to straight up mark a condition on your PC 
or to roll to take a powerful blow, depending on the fiction. The GM gets to 
choose what condition the NPC marks. If the GM tells you to take a powerful 
blow, then you follow that move’s rules to determine what happens next; if the 
GM tells you to mark a condition, then they tell you which condition to mark. 
When you trade blows with a PC threat, you both roll to take a powerful blow. 

#### 關於直面威脅的選項
Resisting or avoiding their blows means you aren’t affected by the trading of 
blows—you either get out of the way of the threat’s strikes or you can just shrug 
them off, depending on what makes sense for your character and the threat. 
This ensures that you come through unscathed, but it doesn’t get you anything 
else—it means all you’ve done is struck the threat and most likely inflicted a 
condition on them. 

Taking something from them means you can take something physical or 
conceptual from the threat. You could, for instance, take the Doomray they’re 
holding in their hands, knocking it out of their grip with one of your punches; 
or, you could take their footing, knocking them to the ground and giving you a 
chance to run; or, you could take their position in front of the controls for the 
Tachyon Cannon. This is your chance to use your attack 
to change your position and theirs.

Creating an opportunity for your allies 
means you’re giving your teammates (or 
other allies) an opening to act or to gain 
some kind of advantage. Maybe 
you hold the villain off to the 
side, so your teammate has 
a shot at reaching the 
Neutrino Bomb. Maybe 
you smash the villain 
straight through the 
air towards your 
teammate, giving 
them a chance to land 
a follow-up strike. 
Either way, this option 
sets up team maneuvers. 

Sometimes, you choose this 
to change the actual situation so 
your teammate has a chance 
to do something they 
couldn’t otherwise do. 
Other times, you’re just 
giving your teammate 
a boost. If it’s the 
former, then choosing 
this option gives your 
teammate that chance. 
If it’s the latter, though, 
then you should add a 
Team to the pool. (For 
more on Team and 
the Team Pool, see page 
48.) The GM tells you which 
it is.

Impress, surprise, or frighten the opposition means you’re affecting how the 
threat perceives you after you’ve traded blows. Maybe you’ve put on such a 
show of force, suddenly they view you with greater respect; or maybe you’ve 
proved that you’re a danger in a way they didn’t see before, and now they try to 
get away from you. The GM picks which option (impress, surprise, or frighten) 
makes the most sense when you choose this option against an NPC threat. For 
NPCs or PCs, the GM might inflict a condition to represent the character’s new 
perspective, if it fits the fiction. 

#### 直面威脅的範例
{{< hint info >}}
Toro the Bull, played by Marissa, is trying to escape from the secret laboratory she 
was taken to after she was knocked out in the last fight. On her way out, she runs into 
an experimental metahuman like herself—her altered clone, in fact—named Ursa. 
Ursa gives her a sadistic grin and extends metallic claws from the tips of each of 
her fingers, an upgrade they never gave to Toro. Marissa says that Toro responds by 
spitting to the side, putting up her fists, and charging in to beat the crud out of Ursa.

Toro’s definitely directly engaging a threat, so I ask Marissa to roll to directly 
engage. She rolls + Danger, and gets a total of 8: she trades blows with Ursa, but 
only gets to choose one option. Marissa chooses to take something from Ursa—in 
this case, Ursa’s claws. I ask Marissa what that looks like, and she describes Toro 
grabbing Ursa’s hands and slamming them into the wall, snapping off her claws. 
That’s awesome, but it doesn’t happen before Ursa gets in some pretty nasty slashes 
on Toro with those claws, and even Toro’s super-hard skin isn’t invulnerable to 
them—I tell Marissa to roll for Toro to take a powerful blow, and I mark a condition 
on Ursa (I think Angry is the right one).

Matt is playing Rex the Transformed, who’s just busted his way into the control deck 
of Vanquish’s attack-mech, a skyscraper-sized robot stomping down Halcyon’s streets. 
Rex surveys the control deck, full of Vanquish’s underlings—a horde of alien chumps 
nowhere near as powerful as the alien overlord himself.

“I wade in and start chucking them around the room. Am I directly engaging?” Matt asks.

“Nah,” I say. “They’re no match for you, no real threat. You’re tossing them 
around without trouble, and it’s completely disrupting control of the attack-mech. 
That is, until you hear Vanquish’s voice call to you from the entrance to the control 
chamber…”
