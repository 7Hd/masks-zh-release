## THE CONVERSATION
Playing MASKS is having a conversation. That means it’s easy! You sit at the table 
with dice and pencils and sheets of paper, and you talk with each other. For 
the most part, the conversation revolves around your characters. You say what 
they do and how they react. Since the other players don’t live in your head, you 
convey your character’s thoughts, emotions, and feelings to the other players 
and the GM. 

There  are  times  in  the  conversation  when  you  slip  directly  into  your 
character’s shoes, no longer narrating but actually taking on your character’s 
persona. You make the gestures your character makes; you say things your 
character says. Most people do this without thinking much about it. It’s pretty 
natural to become your character while you’re playing, to want what they want, 
to fear the outcome of the dice at crucial moments.

The conversation in a roleplaying game evolves naturally over the course 
of the session. But it’s your job as a group to keep the conversation interesting. 
The rules, the techniques, and everything you bring to the table is about driving 
that  conversation  toward  interesting  places.  Explosive  fights!  Emotional 
confessions! Heroic sacrifices! Wherever the fiction takes you.
