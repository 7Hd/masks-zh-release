## 構築場景
要讓對話往有趣的方向發展，最好方法就是「構築場景」。比起坐在桌前含糊不清地談論那些酷炫的角色、他們的身分、或他們能做到什麼之類，不如把這些角色們放到有一個具體的地點場所，並給他們一個具體的目標去採取行動。你不會只說，「哦對，奈微操使擁有操控奈米科技的超能力，所以他可以運用體內的奈米粒子來製造武器！」，相反的，你會把奈微操使放到英雄團隊「典範者」的總部裡，並描述他把他的奈米粒子送進了附近的機器裡並接管了整個總部的安全系統。

把你的故事想成是一本漫畫或超級英雄電影。直接切入最精采的戲劇性奮戰，對抗那些危險的反派、或那些關於在困境下何謂是非對錯的複雜議題。跳過那些無聊的瑣事，直接進入正在發生、或那些即將發生事件的核心。或許這聽起來有些複雜，但它其實不比尋常對話要難多少；一旦你準備好並開始遊戲，遊戲的規則將會帶你走完剩下的路。 儘管GM擁有決定「什麼時候會發生什麼事」的最終決定權，但團隊中的每個人都有責任讓你們故事中的每一個場景都有有趣的開場，並朝有意義的方向發展。

### 強硬構築 Hard Framing
有時候GM會想加快故事的進展，或直接切入一個緊張或困難的局面。也許這會是個你們在過去所做決定而導致的後果，來得又快又狠──你過去意外從異位面傳送門釋放出來的龍型生物再次現身肆虐、或者你隊友的母親終於無法再忍受你們的青少年鬧劇。 GM將告訴你們發生了什麼事，而你的職責就是立即做出反應！

這種技巧被稱為「**強硬構築場景**」，之所以這麼稱呼，是因為它留給玩家的商量餘地較小；場景開始，然後PC們必須盡全力回應。儘管有這樣的慣例，但反派在實行他們卑鄙的陰謀詭計之前也經常不太會給英雄們事先計畫的機會。

喬的角色——「門徒」胡蜂女，在螳螂女──一名技藝高超的白銀世代英雄──的門下受訓。在高雅紳士的訓斥事件中，胡蜂女相較之下比較沒有受到影響，所以我決定要在她的故事中強推一把──畢竟，如果他們沒有被局勢擺布，那他們就不能說是《蒙面少俠》的角色了。

「所以胡蜂女，在開完你們在團隊基地的作戰會議後，妳打算去哪裡？去找螳螂女嗎？妳從上次戰鬥後就沒再和她說過話。」我問道。 

「是的，我會去和她談談。我需要知道她對於找尋那些跟我們交手過的孩子們的下落這件事有什麼想法。」喬回答道。

 「很好。所以妳來到了螳螂女為妳設置的秘密傳送門前，就是隱藏在巷子裡的那個，對吧？然而當妳到達時，施加在傳送門上的偽裝卻沒有它應有的樣子。傳送門看起來受到了破壞，且透過門內傳來的微弱影像，妳看到了不時閃爍著電光的控制台。看起來像是有什麼人硬是扳開了傳送門，然後強行闖了進去，妳打算做什麼？」

### 「你打算做什麼？」
「你打算做什麼？」是《蒙面少俠》中的常用句型。神翠市的步調飛快，因此當數以萬計的太空昆蟲從第五大道那頭的另一扇傳送門中蜂擁而出時，你實在沒有什麼時間能夠好好建構一套詳細的計畫。構築場景的目的就在於盡快讓角色們去面對「你打算做什麼？」的提問。而強硬構築的手法將使這個提問來的又快又急，讓角色們必須立刻回答。

總的來說，《蒙面少俠》是個注重戲劇性行動的遊戲。也許你會對角色們閒談數落前男女朋友的場景有興趣、或者期望制定複雜的計劃來應對危險超人類威脅，但這個遊戲所訴說的終究是一個關於快速決斷和衝動行事的故事。重要的是行動，而即使這行動是充滿戲劇張力和緊繃的對話也一樣。當然這不代表你永遠不會經歷那種沉思默想的時刻，但要明白，它們在這一切動作和戲劇衝突之間可說是相當稀少。畢竟，神翠市的步調可是很快的！



### 遵循敘事
在「回溯修訂」（又稱為「追溯修訂」）這種敘事技巧上，超級英雄漫畫尤其有著相當悠久的歷史。這種敘事技巧被用來撤銷或修正那些故事中已經被陳述的事實。比如說，其實那個角色沒有真的那場爆炸中死去——死掉的是他的外星複製體！真正的本體仍然躺在母艦上的靜止艙裡──這就是所謂的「回溯修訂」。

一個好的「回溯」會去尊重那些被確立為真的事實，並讓其顯得合情合理。
而糟糕的「回溯」則會無視故事中的事實，甚至扭曲環境以確保得到特定的結果。

如果你不去考慮過去確立的敘事脈絡而隨意「回溯」的話，那麼《蒙面少俠》的故事（就像很多超級英雄故事一樣）就會四分五裂。當你在《蒙面少俠》的遊戲對話中說了些什麼，那它就會變成事實，且往後的描述也都需要以它為基礎。堅守你們所確立的事實，遊戲就會獎勵你的紀律。

{{< hint info >}}
「啊，該死。」喬開口：「我要衝進傳送門，但壓低身子躲到控制台後面。如果這裡有其他人在場，我不想讓他們看到我。」

「太好了！」我回答。這是個黃金時機，因為胡蜂女正在獨自一人走向危險。「你穿過了傳送門，且你立刻聽到了迴盪在在一邊的詭異嗡鳴聲，以及一個從控制室某處傳來的聲音：『我一直在等妳過來，小女孩。』那是個古怪，卻又無比熟悉的電子合成音──妳相當確定那就是『科技游蛇』，螳螂女的其中一個老對手。」

「嘔天，我記得她，我不可能打贏她的，也許我就不該進來的。」

「太遲了。妳已經通過了傳送門，而且隨著一陣嘶嘶聲，傳送門也在妳身後嘎然關閉。」

「什麼？！她怎麼做到的？！」

就像我說的，這是個黃金時機。我遵循先前確立的事實來向胡蜂女揭露一個可怕的真相。<br/>
「妳幾乎可以從她的怪異嗓音中聽見她那邪惡的獰笑。『還記得之前有人把一些資料從螳螂女的核心裡偷走了嗎？噢，妳太擔心裡面有什麼東西被帶走或刪除，卻忘記要檢查系統裡有沒有被多植入了些什麼……』」

「啊，該死。」
{{< /hint >}}

在這個例子中，我們從兩個方面堅守著敘事。我讓自己遵循著故事的事實，確立科技游蛇入侵到這裡的方式。同時，我也要求喬遵循敘事，確保胡蜂女合理地堅持了自己的行動。

我試著忠實於故事中的事實——沒有人說過科技游蛇在螳螂女的數據核心中留下了一個代碼炸彈，但我們也從來沒有確定過上次遊戲聚會中到底是誰接觸了螳螂女的數據核心。假如我們已經確定了這個事實——比如說，如果胡蜂女已經得知入侵了螳螂女數據核心的犯人其實是「源碼駭客」——那麼當我說「其實科技游蛇才是真正的犯人」時，那麼我就是在忽視這個敘事事實。

另一方面，胡蜂女採取了一個無法挽回，且對她相當不利的行動——但這其實很棒！當你在玩《蒙面少俠》的時候，你經常會一頭栽進未知的埋伏、脫口說出無意但傷人的話語、或者在使用你的力量時產生預料之外的副作用。你採取行動，並承受後果──而這正是你想要的。你不能收回這些行動，就算你可能想收回也一樣，且你們全體都必須讓每個人都誠實地堅守在故事中實際發生的事情。

你可以會想要澄清、詳述、或打磨你所採取的行動，這也沒有關係。當喬說：「我要衝進傳送門。」時，我可能會問：「你就這樣帶著劈啪作響的電擊警棍衝進去？」而喬可能會回答：「不，我想保持低調和隱匿。」這類澄清和補充完全是可行的，但它們全都不能撤銷已經發生的事情。記住，堅持你所建立的事實。


### 動作與擲骰
Framing scenes starts the conversation in an interesting place, like nocking 
an arrow on the bow and aiming it at a target. But the moves carry the arrow 
to the target. They connect your characters to the fiction in exciting ways, 
and they drive the story in directions you might not expect. Each move is a 
small set of rules that help resolve conflicts, answer questions in the fiction, 
and push the story forward. Moves are like the programming language of the 
game—“When you do x, then y”—shaping and defining the fiction when your 
characters take action.

The basic moves are the core of the game, and any PC can trigger them 
from the start of play. Each character also gets their own playbook moves, 
more specific pieces of programming language that point the characters in 
their own cool and interesting directions. The PCs might add more moves over 
the course of play, too. In general, the basic moves cover situations that come 
up all the time in MASKS stories, while the special moves cover situations that 
are character specific or much more rare.

Every move has a specific trigger, the “When you do x” part of the program. 
They aren’t triggered whenever, or when you feel like they should be, but only 
when your characters are in situations that trigger the move. If you want to 
trigger a move, you have to do the thing that triggers it. (You can also avoid 
a move by avoiding its trigger.) Triggers are almost always tied to the fiction, 
which means all moves are governed by the same principle: if you do it, you do 
it. If you want to trigger the basic move directly engage a threat, then you have 
to directly engage a threat, perhaps charging at a supervillain while screaming 
and swinging your fists. And if you pick up a car in each hand and go swinging 
at the giant robot, you’re directly engaging the threat, and the move triggers, 
whether you like it or not.

Marissa’s  character,  Toro  the  Bull,  is  in  a  super-science  lab—like  the  kind  that 
experimented on her—and she’s not happy about it.

“You recognize the gene vats, the nano-machines, all the equipment, Toro,” I say. 
“It’s weirdly like coming home. And there are people, teenagers like you, floating in 
those gene vats on the far side of the room. The scientists in the room look at you, 
aghast.”

“Oh hell no,” Marissa says. “I start flinging tables over, chucking them around like 
crazy. I want this place messed up.”

I nod. Toro isn’t triggering a move yet; she’s super strong, so flipping these tables 
isn’t exactly difficult for her, and she’s unthreatened. “Yeah, you make a mess. Tables 
up-ended, chemicals spilled, scientists running from you. This room is trashed. That’s 
when a whole squad of black-armored thugs with assault rifles comes into the room. 
They don’t even look like they’re going to ask you to surrender, they’re just going to 
shoot.”

Marissa grins at me. “Awesome. I wade into their midst and start tossing them 
around.”

I nod. “Perfect. You’re directly engaging a threat, definitely.” 

Marissa makes a face. “Oof, hold up, I didn’t think these guys were an actual 
danger. I’m bulletproof, right?”

“Yeah, but they’re well-trained and pouring concentrated fire your way. They’re 
pretty dangerous, even to you. Still want to wade in and toss ’em around?” 

Marissa has time to reconsider and not take the action—she hasn’t crossed the 
Rubicon yet, hasn’t seen the consequences of the action. 

“Yeah,” she says. “Let’s go for it.” 

Marissa looks to the basic move—directly engage a threat—to find out what 
happens next. 
{{< /hint >}}

Often when you trigger a move, you roll dice to see what happens next. 
These are the only times you roll dice in the whole game. You might want 
to roll dice to resolve a situation at other times—don’t, until you’ve actually 
done something in the game that triggers a move. Sometimes you might want 
to trigger a move and go straight to rolling without describing any action in 
the fiction—don’t, until you’ve done something in the game that triggers it. 
Fiction first.

Some moves are just input-output without any random element. No dice 
needed. See New Examplar on page 199 for an example of a move that doesn’t 
need dice.

### 成功與失敗
When a move asks you to roll dice, pick up two six-sided dice (hereafter 
referred  to  as  2d6)  and  roll  them. You’ll  probably  be  asked  to  roll  with 
something or “+” something, like Freak, Danger, Savior, or Conditions Marked. 
That means add that number to whatever comes up on the 2d6. So if you have 
Danger +3, you add 3 to the results on the dice. If you have Savior -2, you 
subtract 2 from the results on the dice. 

You can never roll with more than +4, and less than -3, no matter what 
penalties or bonuses you’d have.

Every move splits up outcomes the same way. A 7 or higher is a “hit,” while 
a 6 or less is a “miss.” A 10 or higher is a “strong hit,” while a 7, 8, or 9 is a “weak 
hit.” Most moves give some results and changes to the fiction between strong 
hits and weak hits, and some may say what happens on a miss. Follow what 
the move says when you roll it.

In  general,  a  hit  means  you  largely  keep  control  of  the  situation  and 
probably get some version of what you want. It’s not always exactly or all that 
you wanted, but it’s the bare minimum. On a weak hit (7-9), you might get 
a distorted version of what you wanted, or you might get some major costs 
attached. On a strong hit (10 or higher), you might get an even better version 
of what you wanted. You almost always want 10+ when you roll (except for 
the one inverted move in the game, take a powerful blow—pay close attention 
to that one!). 

A miss, 6 or less, isn’t the same as a failure. It just means the GM gets full 
say over what happens next, and chances are you won’t like it. The GM will 
probably make things worse for you in some way, tighten the screws more, but 
it doesn’t have to be the worst possible thing that could happen, and it doesn’t 
even have to mean that you actually failed. Some of the most interesting misses 
give you exactly what you wanted, in the worst possible way. 

{{< hint info >}}
Marissa rolls to toss those black-clad goons around, and sadly rolls 2, with Danger 
+2, for a total of 4. A miss.

“Yeah, you’re thrown into the mix with them, and they’re pumping bullets your 
way, but you largely shrug them off as you chuck these soldier types around, sending 
them flying into tables and walls with abandon. When you hurl the last one all the 
way up against the ceiling and watch them fall back down, you notice their features 
underneath the cracked helmet. This guy’s a teenager. You peel off the helmet and 
find a guy no older than you, but with implants in his skin, probably something 
ensuring his compliance. Each one you check is the same, another teen, showing 
signs of experimentation. You just beat up your lab-siblings, the same people you 
were hoping to save.” 

Marissa groans. “Oof. Now I feel terrible.”
{{< /hint >}}

The GM doesn’t roll dice in MASKS, ever. The GM just says what happens, 
making moves when a player rolls a miss, when the conversation gets boring, 
or when a move tells them to contribute. These limits ensure the GM sets up 
situations in which the PCs are forced to react. For more about GM moves, 
check out page 135.


### TRIGGERS AND UNCERTAINTY
There are only seven basic moves in MASKS, and a limited number of other 
moves. Does that mean you can only do those things in the game? Why would 
we limit it like that?

The answer is simple: the moves point to places where no one knows 
what happens next. 

If your superpower is flight, and you want to fly over the city, no urgency, 
no rush...then there’s no uncertainty. The players and the GM all know exactly 
what happens next. You just do it. 

If you, someone with super strength and super speed, want to knock out a 
completely mundane citizen (for some reason)...there’s no uncertainty. They 
can’t hurt you, stop you, or affect you. You just do it. 

If you want to throw a quick snarky insult at someone, nothing too biting or 
incisive, nothing that demands a response, there’s no uncertainty. You just do it. 
But when you’re trying to fly faster than Lightning Streak to make sure 
you get to the Interdimensional Quantum Stabilizer first, then no one, not the 
player or the GM, knows what happens. That’s when a move triggers (in this 
case, unleash your powers). 

When you’re trying to knock down the Stone Titan with your fists, to stop 
the towering fifteen foot behemoth of stone, then no one knows what happens 
next. That’s when a move triggers (in this case, directly engage a threat). 
When you’re trying to throw a biting insult that makes Vanquish turn away 
from the Cosmic Battery to fight you, abandoning sense and reason to smash 
you into the ground for your insolence, then no one knows what happens next. 
That’s when a move triggers (in this case, provoke someone). 

Your character can do anything that it makes sense they can do, within the 
story. Moves resolve situations in which both player and GM aren’t sure what 
happens next, to tell you what happens next. They highlight the natural tension 
points in a MASKS story. 

When a move is triggered, everyone around the table doesn’t know what 
will happen, including the GM. When a PC tries to suck all the power out of 
an enormous robot and channel it directly into the city’s power grid, no one 
around the table is sure what will happen until that move is resolved. And 
when it’s resolved, everyone knows where the story goes next.

Sometimes, the GM and the players have to talk a bit to get on the same 
page about the uncertainty. A PC wants to fly into space, and the GM feels that 
it’s uncertain if they can because they’ve never done it before. But the player’s 
always had it in their head that they can fly into space, should the need arise. 
The player and the GM have to quickly figure out if this is truly uncertain. The 
point of moves is to make us excited, interested, and surprised about what 
happens next, and if someone doesn’t feel excitement around the uncertainty, 
then it’s a good sign that either a move isn’t being triggered, or someone doesn’t 
fully understand the situation. Talk it out and find a place where you agree 
on the uncertainty, then make the move that makes sense. Or no move at all.

For more on the basic moves and when or why they’re triggered, check out 
page 55.
