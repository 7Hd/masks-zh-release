# 開始遊戲之前
在你遊玩《蒙面少俠》之前，你需要先準備好一些東西，也需要先考慮好一些議題。

## 準備遊玩
你需要一個供你們遊戲的空間。如果你們打算面對面跑團，那麼你會需要一張夠大的桌子，讓每個人圍坐在桌邊，分散開來，保留一些擺放他們角色卡並擲骰的空間。確保你們已經準備好了所有你們需要的道具：基本動作和扮演書的影本、每個玩家各一對骰子、一些用來追蹤影響力的指示物、一疊索引卡或便利貼、以及一些鉛筆。

設好界線，這樣你才不會被其他人給侵擾或冒犯。不要猶豫在需要的時候休息一下──儘管不要有人在遊戲中途停下來跑去吃飯會更好，但上個廁所、點心時間、站起來伸展一下之類的短暫休息都沒有關係。不需要趕進度。


## 神翠市
如果你們遊玩《蒙面少俠》，那你們的遊戲舞台將會發生在神翠市。「關於神翠市」的章節記載了關於神翠市的情報，蒙面少俠的其他擴充書也提供了更多進一步的資訊（《神翠市先驅報集錦》和《神盾局的秘密》）。但事情是這樣的：最終，這都是你們的神翠市，按你們所需要的去改變、調整、適應它吧。

然而無論如何，關於神翠市有幾個關鍵要點是無論如何都會成立的：

* 自二十世紀初以來，這裡已經歷經了整整三個世代的超級英雄、超級反派、以及超自然災難。玩家角色是第四個世代的成員。過往世代的成員們如今仍然活躍，且都對神翠市的未來很感興趣。

* The city’s pretty used to all kinds of insanity, from dinosaurs rampaging down the streets, to dark wizards transforming sections of the city into castles, to parallel dimensions appearing in the sky, to aliens invading. That doesn’t mean these things aren’t still amazing and surprising, but they happen, and they’re a fact of life in the city—Halcyon rolls on, even after something that seems like it should change everything.

* The city is the greatest city in the world, huge and full of nearly anything you could expect to find in any city anywhere. Monuments, museums, massive corporations, slums, dark alleys, subways, whatever. Huge districts encompass many different populations and neighborhoods throughout the city, and the people living here represent diverse populations.

Other than that, if you need or want to change the details, go for it. If you don’t think your version of Halcyon City has A.E.G.I.S. (the secretive governmental law enforcement organization targeted towards metahumans), but instead has a metahuman SWAT team force, that’s great. If you think your version of Halcyon City has a mayor who’s a former superhero, that’s awesome. So is having a mayor who hates superheroes. 

Adapt the city to your own choices. Ask questions and fill it in as you go. Ultimately, Halcyon is your sandbox. 


## 建立共識
Superhero stories span a huge medley of styles and genres, from goofy to just plain fun to dark and gritty. It’s important that everybody’s on the same page about what to expect from the tone and style of your MASKS game. There’s room for you to nudge the tone according to your table’s choices, and the playbooks you select inherently change the game’s style. But here are some basic elements you always need to think about.

### 生長於一個充滿超級英雄的世界
In MASKS, all the characters are residents of Halcyon City. They may not have lived there for their whole lives, but they’ve been there long enough to get a gist of the place. That means they know about the long tradition of superheroes and villains, they know about the craziness that happens on the city streets, and they know they’re part of that world. Everyone can name at least a few heroes and villains. Everyone can remember at least one incident of seeing a superhero or supernatural event. This isn’t happening for the first time; super stuff isn’t brand new—it’s a fact of life.

What’s more, because the characters are part of that world, they’re all of interest to someone. The older generations are guaranteed to be invested in you and who you become, whether it’s because they want to stop you from becoming a great hero, or because they want to foster you, or whatever. There’s no way you’ll slip by unnoticed, or receive support from those older heroes without any conflict at all; be prepared. 

### 你的團隊
In MASKS, you always play a team of young superheroes. The specifics of your team are filled in by many of the choices you make during character creation, from the playbooks you choose to the questions you answer from the GM. But a few pieces of your team are always true:

<b>You all choose to be here.</b> You might be pressured to be on the team, you might feel guilt and be part of the team to absolve it, you might audibly wish you weren’t on the team at all while secretly loving it. But ultimately, it’s always your choice to be part of the team. That’s why the team won’t fracture in a heartbeat—one way or another, you want to be here, for whatever reason fits your character.

<b>You aren’t killers.</b> You’re a fairly young team, and you may have made some mistakes and blown some stuff up. Your actions might have led to deaths. But you aren’t killers; you don’t solve problems by killing those on the other side as if it were of no consequence. If your team is interested in pursuing more drastic measures, you might grapple with the complexities of killing as a solution to difficult problems. But so far, your team hasn’t gone down that dark path.

<b>You aren’t illegal or openly hunted yet.</b> Your team might technically be illegal, depending on the specifics of how superhuman teams are treated in your version of Halcyon City. But even if you are, you aren’t yet hunted by the authorities. Adults are more than likely making overtures to your team, offering to sanction you or guide you and thereby provide you with whatever legal support you need. The actions you take over the course of play may lead you to a place where you’re actively pursued or captured, but that’s not the case at the start of play.

<b>You aren’t beloved.</b> Just as you aren’t yet hunted by other superheroes or by law enforcement, you also aren’t beloved by the city yet. You might be more or less well-liked, more or less doubted, but either way your team hasn’t been around long enough for the public to truly develop any kind of abiding interest in and fondness for your team yet. If you’re loved, it’s the love of celebrity, temporary and easily turned to hate.
