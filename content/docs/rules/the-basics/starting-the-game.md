# 開始遊戲之前
在你遊玩《蒙面少俠》之前，你需要先準備好一些東西，也需要先考慮好一些議題。

## 準備遊玩
You need a space to play. If you’re playing face-to-face, you want a table big enough for everybody to sit around it, spread out a bit, put their character sheets down, and roll dice. Make sure you’ve got printed copies of the basic moves and the playbooks ready to go, along with a pair of dice for each player, some tokens for tracking Influence, a batch of index cards or post-its, and a bunch of pencils. 

During play, establish some boundaries so you aren’t disturbed by people around you. Don’t hesitate to take breaks when needed—while it’s better if nobody stops for a meal in the middle of play, bathroom breaks, snack breaks, stand-up-and-stretch breaks are just fine. No need to rush.

## 神翠市
If you’re playing MASKS, you’re playing in Halcyon City. THE CITY on page 15 has information about Halcyon City, and there’re a few other books in the MASKS line that offer even more information ( HALCYON CITY HERALD COLLECTION, SECRETS OF A.E.G.I.S.). But here’s the thing: ultimately, Halcyon City is yours to play with, change, modify, and adapt as you choose. 

A few key things should be true about Halcyon City, no matter what:

* There have been three full generations of superheroes, supervillains, and super-powered calamities before now, stretching back into the earlier parts of the 20th century. The PCs are members of a fourth generation. Members of the prior generations are still active and interested in the future of Halcyon City.

* The city’s pretty used to all kinds of insanity, from dinosaurs rampaging down the streets, to dark wizards transforming sections of the city into castles, to parallel dimensions appearing in the sky, to aliens invading. That doesn’t mean these things aren’t still amazing and surprising, but they happen, and they’re a fact of life in the city—Halcyon rolls on, even after something that seems like it should change everything.

* The city is the greatest city in the world, huge and full of nearly anything you could expect to find in any city anywhere. Monuments, museums, massive corporations, slums, dark alleys, subways, whatever. Huge districts encompass many different populations and neighborhoods throughout the city, and the people living here represent diverse populations.

Other than that, if you need or want to change the details, go for it. If you don’t think your version of Halcyon City has A.E.G.I.S. (the secretive governmental law enforcement organization targeted towards metahumans), but instead has a metahuman SWAT team force, that’s great. If you think your version of Halcyon City has a mayor who’s a former superhero, that’s awesome. So is having a mayor who hates superheroes. 

Adapt the city to your own choices. Ask questions and fill it in as you go. Ultimately, Halcyon is your sandbox. 


## 建立共識
Superhero stories span a huge medley of styles and genres, from goofy to just plain fun to dark and gritty. It’s important that everybody’s on the same page about what to expect from the tone and style of your MASKS game. There’s room for you to nudge the tone according to your table’s choices, and the playbooks you select inherently change the game’s style. But here are some basic elements you always need to think about.

### 生長於一個充滿超級英雄的世界
In MASKS, all the characters are residents of Halcyon City. They may not have lived there for their whole lives, but they’ve been there long enough to get a gist of the place. That means they know about the long tradition of superheroes and villains, they know about the craziness that happens on the city streets, and they know they’re part of that world. Everyone can name at least a few heroes and villains. Everyone can remember at least one incident of seeing a superhero or supernatural event. This isn’t happening for the first time; super stuff isn’t brand new—it’s a fact of life.

What’s more, because the characters are part of that world, they’re all of interest to someone. The older generations are guaranteed to be invested in you and who you become, whether it’s because they want to stop you from becoming a great hero, or because they want to foster you, or whatever. There’s no way you’ll slip by unnoticed, or receive support from those older heroes without any conflict at all; be prepared. 

### 你的團隊
In MASKS, you always play a team of young superheroes. The specifics of your team are filled in by many of the choices you make during character creation, from the playbooks you choose to the questions you answer from the GM. But a few pieces of your team are always true:

<b>You all choose to be here.</b> You might be pressured to be on the team, you might feel guilt and be part of the team to absolve it, you might audibly wish you weren’t on the team at all while secretly loving it. But ultimately, it’s always your choice to be part of the team. That’s why the team won’t fracture in a heartbeat—one way or another, you want to be here, for whatever reason fits your character.

<b>You aren’t killers.</b> You’re a fairly young team, and you may have made some mistakes and blown some stuff up. Your actions might have led to deaths. But you aren’t killers; you don’t solve problems by killing those on the other side as if it were of no consequence. If your team is interested in pursuing more drastic measures, you might grapple with the complexities of killing as a solution to difficult problems. But so far, your team hasn’t gone down that dark path.

<b>You aren’t illegal or openly hunted yet.</b> Your team might technically be illegal, depending on the specifics of how superhuman teams are treated in your version of Halcyon City. But even if you are, you aren’t yet hunted by the authorities. Adults are more than likely making overtures to your team, offering to sanction you or guide you and thereby provide you with whatever legal support you need. The actions you take over the course of play may lead you to a place where you’re actively pursued or captured, but that’s not the case at the start of play.

<b>You aren’t beloved.</b> Just as you aren’t yet hunted by other superheroes or by law enforcement, you also aren’t beloved by the city yet. You might be more or less well-liked, more or less doubted, but either way your team hasn’t been around long enough for the public to truly develop any kind of abiding interest in and fondness for your team yet. If you’re loved, it’s the love of celebrity, temporary and easily turned to hate.
