## 為什麼要玩這個遊戲？
But why do this? Why go to all this work to tell a story, when TV, movie 
theaters, and even book stores are full of superhero stories you can consume 
without having to do any of the work to write them yourself?

Because it’s frickin’ awesome!

Because  when  you  play  MASKS,  you  create  your  own  cool  superheroes, 
interesting and competent and powerful and capable of heading up their 
own comic books. You then watch those characters bounce off each other 
in dramatic, tense, and most of all fun ways. You create your own team of 
superheroes and watch them argue, draw together, and kick all the butts!

Because superhero stories let you play with whatever crazy elements you 
like, and weave them all together into one awesome tapestry. Vampires? Sure! 
Robots? Definitely! Aliens? Of course! Alien robot vampires? Why the heck 
not! Superhero comics are unselfconscious about their zaniness, and they let 
you tap into the same wellspring of unrestrained creativity, and just have fun 
making stuff up!

Because  we  can  all  relate  to  these  characters  and  their 
stories. We all have to grow up eventually, so you’ve either 
done it already, are doing it right now, or are going to do 
it someday. We’ve all felt it when someone else’s 
words  have  changed  how  we  saw 
ourselves,  and  we’ve  all  had  to 
decide  whether  to  take  that,  or 
to  reject  it  and  find  something 
else.  And  that  means  what  these 
characters are going through, even with all 
the spider-demons and the super-police and 
the costumed burglars, is relatable and even 
real to us.

Because  these  stories  of  young  heroes 
and their superpowers and their battles are 
about regular human drama, writ big and 
large  and  loud.  They’re  melodramatic 
and they’re engaging, and they’re over 
the top, and if you invest even a bit 
of yourself you’ll get sucked in.

Because everyone wants to tell 
you who to be. And you’ve got 
to find your own path, kid.
