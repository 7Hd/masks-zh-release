# BUILDING CUSTOM MOVES
Moves generally consist of:
* A trigger: “When (something) happens…”
* An outcome: “...then (something else) happens.” This might include a roll of the dice, or it might just be something that happens.
* Stakes: If the move does have a roll, say what happens on a 10+, a 7-9, and a 6-.

You’ve also got to define the 10+, 7-9, and miss results: a 10+ means things
generally work out; a 7-9 means there’s some cost or complication; and a 6-
mean things usually get worse.

Beyond those core components, though, you need to make sure any custom
moves you create do two things:
* Trigger on an interesting and uncertain action
* Lead to outcomes that push the fiction forward


## TRIGGERS
The key to making good triggers is that the actions themselves need to
be interesting and exciting, and only likely to occur when there’s actual
uncertainty about what will happen. You don’t want triggers based on boring
actions, and you don’t want triggers that come up too often.

Here’s a move with a bad trigger:

<div class='Move'>
When you lie to an adult, roll + Superior. On a 10+, they buy your lie. On a 7-9,
answer their questions, and you’re good. On a miss, they see right through you...and
you’re in trouble.
</div>

The trigger is so non-specific, the PCs will trigger it all the time, even when
it isn’t all that interesting, even when an adult would absolutely believe their
lies. It’s not evocative on its own, and it won’t lead to interesting fiction as a
result. The trigger would be stronger if it were more focused, like when you
feed false information to the Exemplars.

Here’s a move with a better trigger:

<div class='Move'>
When you make a statement to the cameras, roll + Superior. On a 10+, choose three.
On a 7-9, choose two.
• you convince the viewing audience to see your team according to a Label of your choice
• your statement will bring you an opportunity from a viewer
• your statement frames you, in particular, as a successful and noteworthy hero of the city; mark potential
• you don’t anger or upset anyone important or powerful with your statement 

On a miss, your statement goes awry, and listeners interpret your words in the worst possible way.
</div>

Now, it’s about a specific instance, something that won’t happen all the time.
It says something about your game, too—your game is, in part, about what
your PCs say to the public of the city. And finally, there’s uncertainty attached
to that trigger. We don’t know what happens when one of your PCs makes a
statement to the cameras, and that’s why we have the move.

#### COMMON TRIGGER TYPES
<b>Character action</b>: Moves can trigger when a character takes action. To make
a strong move, always tie that action to specifics—action in a particular place,
against a particular character, with a particular item, and so on.

<div class='Move'>
The Overbrain’s Helmet: When you put on the Omnihelmet and telepathically
search for someone, roll + Freak. On a hit, you learn exactly where they are and what
they’re doing right now. On a 7-9, the connection is stronger than you expected; give
them Influence over you or mark a condition, your choice. On a miss, you find them,
but you alert the Overbrain to your location; brace yourself.
</div>

<b>Situation</b>: Moves can trigger due to the specific situation a PC is in, usually
because an NPC or the environment takes action. The PC still has to be there
and be involved, though, for the move to trigger.

<div class='Move'>
Bloodhounds: When Agent Hersh and her metahuman detectors are hunting you,
roll + Mundane. On a hit, you can avoid detection if you flee, now. On a 10+, you get
the drop on Agent Hersh—you can ambush her or let her pass, your call. On a miss,
they’ve got you dead to rights.
</div>

<b>From now on</b>: Moves can trigger as soon as you take them, and the effects
go on continuously. They don’t need an explicit trigger.

<div class='Move'>
New Exemplar: [When you take this move and ever afterward…] Sign the contract
and join the Exemplars. Take +1 ongoing any time you wield your authority or
speak publicly. While you’re part of their team, you can never reject the Exemplars’
Influence over you.
</div>

<b>Right now and done</b>: Moves can trigger once, as soon as you take them.
Again, no explicit trigger is needed.

<div class='Move'>
The Forge: [Immediately after you take this move…] When you go into one of
VENOM’s Forge brainwashing tubes, it rearranges your mind and memories to make
you a weapon. Shift your Labels around however you want, so long as your overall
total remains the same and Danger ends at +3. The GM tells you what memory you
lose during the change.
</div>

## EFFECTS

Triggers are only one half of a move. You need to know what happens when a
move is triggered, too, and those effects need to be interesting and cool all on
their own. Good effects push the fiction forward and lead to more moves. If a
move doesn’t produce clear new paths after it’s been triggered, then its effects
are weak.

Here’s a move with weak effects:

<div class='Move'>
When you try to pass the threshold of Magus Everard’s Sanctum, roll + Freak. On a
10+, you get in. On a 7-9, you get in, but only if you give Everard Influence over you.
On a miss, you can’t get in.
</div>

None of its possible outcomes are particularly interesting. Getting inside
the Sanctum is interesting, but only because the Sanctum itself is interesting—
this move doesn’t make it any more so. Giving Everard Influence allows for a
Label shift, but devoid of anything else, that’s not very interesting and it’s
detached from the fiction. The miss just plain shuts down the fiction.

Here’s a move with much better effects:

<div class='Move'>
When you hack into Rook Laboratories, roll + Superior. On a 10+,
choose two. On a 7-9, choose one.
• you find information that leaves Rook vulnerable; the GM tells
you how
• you find information that clears up a question of yours; the
GM answers the question
• you find information that fills in a weakness of someone else;
name them, and the GM tells you their vulnerability
• you don’t leave a trace
On a miss, choose one anyway, but you reveal your
intrusion to Rook Security; they know where you are,
and they’re coming...
</div>

In this move, none of the options are explicitly
mechanical—they don’t provide Influence or shift Labels or
anything similar. But they’ll all lead to interesting places
in the story. No matter what information a PC finds, it
opens up new paths for new moves. And if a PC doesn’t
choose “you don’t leave a trace,” the GM has a golden
opportunity to make a move.


#### COMMON EFFECT TYPES
<b>Direct Effects</b>: Moves can directly affect the fiction, making changes, causing
events, without touching on any mechanical pieces in between.

<div class='Move'>
The Warden : When you slap the Cosmic Warden’s Voidcuffs on someone with
powers, they lose those powers for as long as they are cuffed.
</div>

<b>Label swap</b>: You can create custom moves that change which Labels are used
with which basic moves in particular situations. Always make these Label swap
moves tied to specific situations.

<div class='Move'>
Leech: Powersink saps the metahuman abilities of everyone around him. When you
directly engage Powersink in physical combat, roll + Mundane instead of + Danger.
</div>

<b>Add options</b>: Custom moves can add further options to existing moves,
expanding how they’re useful and making them specific to their surroundings.

<div class='Move'>
Hall of Mirrors: When you assess the situation in the Hall of Eternal Worlds, add
these two questions to the list of options:
• What terrible future for me do I see in one of the mirrors?
• What magnificent future for me do I see in one of the mirrors?
</div>

<b>Inflict a condition</b>: You can always have custom moves inflict conditions on
PCs. Those moves indicate ways that the PCs’ emotions can be affected and
changed, whether they like it or not.

<div class='Move'>
Emotion Vampire: When you reject Solace’s Influence, mark a condition of his
choice in addition to any other results of the move.
</div>

<b>Take or give Influence/shift Labels</b>: You can use custom moves to affect
Influence and Label shifting. The two are intimately tied together, but a move
that takes Influence sets up for later Label shifts, while a move that directly
shifts Labels is immediate and powerful.

<div class='Move'>
Just a Child: The Cuckoo possesses and empowers the bodies of children; it makes
the body diamond-hard, yet it still appears as a child. When you directly engage the
Cuckoo, it takes Influence over you unless you have seen its true form.
</div>

<b>Choose options</b>: You can set up custom moves that allow players to pick
options from a list. The list provides some clear courses for the fiction to follow,
without defining exactly which path it will go down. Make sure that all the
choices on the list are juicy and interesting, each one leading to new possible
moves.

<div class='Move'>
Paper Men: When you take on an army of Carceri drone soldiers, roll + Danger. On
a hit, you win, but barely: you must mark three conditions, and the collateral damage
is expansive. On a 10+, choose two. On a 7-9, choose one.
• you escape the fight with only a few scratches and some trauma; mark one
condition instead of three
• you win the fight definitively and seize Carceri prisoners, weapons, and
equipment
• you minimize the collateral damage to the city and those around you
On a miss, you lose the fight and wake up on a Carceri prison ship. Good luck.
</div>

You can play a few tricks with lists of options, too, including setting up
negative lists where players choose which of a set of bad options they want
to avoid.

<div class='Move'>
Gaze of the Abyss: When the demon creature Gehenna invades your mind, roll +
Superior. On a 10+, choose one. On a 7-9, choose two. On a miss, all three.
• tell Gehenna the person you care about the most in the whole world
• tell Gehenna the one thing you want above anything else
• tell Gehenna the danger you fear the most
</div>

<b>Hold and spend</b>: These kinds of moves are pretty much the same as setting
up a list. The difference is that hold allows players to make their choices later,
after they’ve rolled for the original move, instead of right then and there.

<div class='Move'>
Plug ’n’ Play: When you take a dose of Stormbolt Six, roll + Danger. On a 10+, hold
three. On a 7-9, hold two. On a miss, hold one. Spend your hold 1 for 1 to:
• emit an EMP pulse; take out any electronics in your area
• charge your fists with lightning; inflict an additional condition when you directly
engage
• teleport to any location in sight by riding a lightning bolt there
• stun anyone in your vicinity with a thunderclap
When all your hold is spent, mark a condition and take a powerful blow as the
Stormcloud Six works its way through your system.
