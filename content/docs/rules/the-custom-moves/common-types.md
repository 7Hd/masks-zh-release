## COMMON CUSTOM MOVE TYPES
Between sessions, you can create custom moves for nearly any use. Here are some
of the most common places where custom moves are useful and interesting.
Remember that if you take advantage of any of these opportunities, you shouldn’t
hide it—make sure the players know, so they can use these moves!

#### SITUATIONS
Custom moves are great for filling in specific holes in your game. If there’s a
situation that seems interesting and uncertain, but none of the basic moves
quite cover it, that’s a good sign you should add a custom move. Superhero
stories can span vastly different genres and styles, including all kinds of crazy
elements, so don’t hesitate to come up with new custom moves to deal with
those surprising situations.

### ITEMS
MASKS is a game of superhero stories, and superhero stories are chock-a-block
full of MacGuffins and crazy super science doodads and fantasy artifacts.
Making custom moves for these objects gives them greater importance in your
game, and genuinely makes them more significant than just being things that
everybody’s after.

### POWERS AND ABILITIES
Especially when PCs pick up unique or additional powers, a custom move may
be in order. MASKS covers a lot of ground with fictional positioning, but custom
moves can draw out important and specific powers. This doesn’t just have to
be superhuman powers—if the Beacon connects with an Internet community
of other would-be superheroes, then giving them a custom move to use that
network is a great idea.

### FRAMING SCENES
You can use custom moves to frame scenes quickly and skip past some of
the action. For instance, if the PCs might infiltrate the superhuman prison
known as the Spike, instead of spending time making several individual rolls
to unleash powers or assess the situation, you could make a custom move that
accounts for the whole infiltration in a single roll.

### LOVE LETTERS
When a player misses a session and you want to catch them up, or when you
want to start some conflicts fast and hard, love letters are what you’re looking
for. Love letters give more information and setup than regular custom moves,
and they can quickly and easily resolve cliffhangers.

##### LOVE LETTER EXAMPLE
<div class='Move'>
Dear Sureshot,
When last we left you, you’d fallen off that crevasse in the Other Realm and
disappeared into the darkness. Man, that must’ve sucked, right?
Let’s find out how you’re doing here. For better or worse, this is all about your
skills, your abilities...the special things you can do. Roll + Freak. On a 10+, you’re
banged up, but you’re still pretty operational, and you can reconnect to your team
soon. On a 7-9, mark two conditions, but you’re still up and moving. On a miss, you’re
in deep trouble. Mark any conditions you didn’t already have marked. Your body’s
pretty broken, and if you don’t get real help soon, you may not make it back home.
Best of luck, buddy. You’ll need it.
Hugs and kisses,
Your GM
</div>

You can use love letters to immediately set up the situation, too. This is
great for when you’re running MASKS as a single session one-shot game, instead
of a campaign.

<div class='Move'>
Dear Toro,
Make your character like normal, but your starting role for The Bull’s Heart is
Defender.
You don’t know your real name. You don’t really know where you’re from. You
might be from a test tube. You might be an amnesiac. You might be a clone, or a secret
robot, or any of countless options. Some part of you doesn’t want to find out...but
some other part needs to know.
The guys in black armor with the weird glowing guns, they’ve come for you a
few times. This most recent attack was the worst, though. You’re pretty sure they pull
their punches—they’re trying to take you alive, not kill you—but this time, they let
’er rip against the city and people around you. Seems they’ve figured out you actually
care if people get hurt...
Let’s find out exactly what happened. Roll + Danger. On a 10+, choose two. On
a 7-9, choose one.
• you took ’em down quick, and few people were hurt—shift Savior up and any
other Label down, if you want
• you caught one and scared him into talking—a first for you, but you’ve got a
lead on who sent these goons
• you didn’t let them get to you; if you don’t choose this option, mark Angry
On a miss, it was bad. You won, but people were hurt...and they planted a tracer
on you. Which you’re only finding now. Right as they’re coming for you. Mark Angry
and one other condition of your choice.
Hope you can handle them!
Hugs and kisses,
Your GM
</div>

## SPIN-OFFS
There are tons of custom moves you can make to hone and focus your game
of MASKS—the game is a framework that’s plenty strong enough to manage your
permutations. But you can push it hard, too, creating custom moves that really
push the game into whole new directions.

Here are a few examples of some big changes you can make with custom
moves in MASKS.

<div class='Move'>
SPENDABLE INFLUENCE
When you take Influence over someone, hold the token. You can hold multiple Influence
tokens over the same character. Spend your Influence when you choose to:
• take +1 on a move against that character
• inflict a condition on that character
• ask that character a question; they must answer honestly
• (for PCs) shift that character’s Labels, one up and one down
• (for PCs) offer that character the chance to mark potential if they do what you want
• (for PCs) give that character -2 on a move against you
</div>

This change will have repercussions all over the system, so if you go with
it, you’ll have to tweak a bunch of other moves a bit. The ultimate effect,
though, is that Influence becomes more of a spendable resource, something
you accumulate and then use. It makes the game much more directly about
emotional manipulation and leverage—most likely, a game with these rules
would be darker and more cynical.

<div class='Move'>
CUSTOM CONDITIONS
When you take a condition, write down a word or short phrase to represent the
emotional state afflicting you. When that condition would impede you, take -1 to any
moves you make. When another PC can take advantage of your condition, they take +1 to
any moves they make against you. They really have to take advantage of your condition
in the fiction to get the bonus, though.
If you take appropriate action in the fiction to relieve your condition, you can clear it.
</div>

Custom conditions allow for a much wider array of descriptions of
the emotions the PCs undergo, and they give you a lot more freedom in
interpreting when a condition actually affects the situation. But they also lose
a lot of their focus and tightness—you no longer have clear situations in which
the condition does or doesn’t matter, and you lose the clear path to removing
the condition.

<div class='Move'>
HARM
Characters start play with varying numbers of boxes in their harm tracks. PCs always
have six. NPCs have a number equal to their conditions.
When you trade blows with an NPC, inflict one harm on them. As one of your choices
for directly engaging a threat, you can choose to inflict an additional harm. If you use
overwhelming force against a target, you should inflict an additional harm anyway; the
GM tells you when that’s appropriate.
When you take a powerful blow, mark one box on your harm track. If half the boxes
of your harm track are marked, you’re not doing so hot; what once may have been easy
now requires you to unleash your powers. If all boxes on your harm track are marked,
you’re in very bad shape; you’re likely to die without immediate help.
If an NPC ever fills their harm track, they go unconscious. Without help, they’ll die.
The GM can inflict harm as a hard move.
</div>

Maybe you want physical harm to have more meaning in your game.
Adding a set of custom mechanics like this makes everyone pay more attention
to physical damage, and the threat of dying becomes real. The tone of the
game takes a huge swing for darker territory, with death genuinely on the
line, and Danger takes on a much greater significance as beating enemies into
submission becomes a much more straightforward and effective tactic.

<div class='Move'>
FASTER ADVANCEMENT
At the end of each session, answer the following three questions. For each yes, mark
potential.
• Did we beat a dangerous enemy?
• Did we learn more about a threatening plot?
• Did we connect with each other as a team?
</div>
This kind of change may seem pretty small, ultimately, but it plays into
many of the other economies and balances of MASKS. PCs advance much more
quickly when they often get three more potential at the end of the session.
But this also strongly incentivizes taking those specific actions described in
the move and it takes some emphasis off the existing ways to gain potential—
namely, making moves with lower Labels so you roll a miss.

You could tweak the questions attached to this move to really define the
specific kind of game you’re playing. You could come up with specific questions
for every playbook in your game, if you wanted. All of them would drive play
down particular paths much more strongly, and ensure PCs reach their upper
level advances much sooner.

<div class='Move'>
TEAM STAT
The team as a whole gains a Team stat, and a Team track with five boxes.
Your Team stat starts the game at +0. Your Team stat can never go higher than +3
or lower than -2.
Whenever you would add a Team to the pool, mark a box on the track instead. When
you mark the fifth box, clear it and increase your Team stat by +1. Whenever you would
spend a Team from the pool, instead clear one box on the track. If there are no filled boxes
to clear, then decrease your Team stat by -1.
When you help a teammate, roll + Team. On a hit, add +1 to their roll. On a 7-9, clear
one box on the Team track. On a miss, clear one box on the Team track in addition to any
other hard moves.
When you act selfishly, say how your actions ignore or insult your teammates and roll
+ Team instead of your usual Label on any move. After the move is resolved, decrease
the Team stat by -1.
</div>

This is a big change, one that messes with a core economy of the game—
Team. Team is less transitory; increasing the Team score can feel cooler than
just adding Team to the pool. It’s also going to be a lot easier for teammates to
help each other; even when Team’s at +0, PCs will now be able to roll it to help
each other out. The added rules might also slow down the game a bit.
