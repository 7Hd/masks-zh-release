## 常見自訂動作類型
Between sessions, you can create custom moves for nearly any use. Here are some
of the most common places where custom moves are useful and interesting.
Remember that if you take advantage of any of these opportunities, you shouldn’t
hide it—make sure the players know, so they can use these moves!

### 情境
Custom moves are great for filling in specific holes in your game. If there’s a
situation that seems interesting and uncertain, but none of the basic moves
quite cover it, that’s a good sign you should add a custom move. Superhero
stories can span vastly different genres and styles, including all kinds of crazy
elements, so don’t hesitate to come up with new custom moves to deal with
those surprising situations.

### 物品
MASKS is a game of superhero stories, and superhero stories are chock-a-block
full of MacGuffins and crazy super science doodads and fantasy artifacts.
Making custom moves for these objects gives them greater importance in your
game, and genuinely makes them more significant than just being things that
everybody’s after.

### 超能力和異能
Especially when PCs pick up unique or additional powers, a custom move may
be in order. MASKS covers a lot of ground with fictional positioning, but custom
moves can draw out important and specific powers. This doesn’t just have to
be superhuman powers—if the Beacon connects with an Internet community
of other would-be superheroes, then giving them a custom move to use that
network is a great idea.

### 構築場景
You can use custom moves to frame scenes quickly and skip past some of
the action. For instance, if the PCs might infiltrate the superhuman prison
known as the Spike, instead of spending time making several individual rolls
to unleash powers or assess the situation, you could make a custom move that
accounts for the whole infiltration in a single roll.

### 情書
當玩家錯過遊戲聚會而你想要讓他們跟上進度、或當你想要快速強硬地開始一些衝突場景時，「情書」就是你最好的選擇。情書能夠提供比一般自訂動作更多的訊息和設置，且它們能更快速容易地處理故事懸念。

##### 情書範例
<div class='Move'>
親愛的 神射手：

在上次我們離開你的時候，你掉進了異界裂縫並消失在黑暗之中。老兄，這肯定糟透了，對吧？

讓我們來看看你在那裡過的怎麼樣。無論好壞，這全都得指望你的技巧、能力……以及你能做到所有特別的一切。擲<b>+古怪</b>。

<tag>擲出10+時</tag>, 你受了點傷，但行動並沒有大礙，且你很快就能重新和你的團隊會合。<br/>
<tag>擲出7-9時</tag>，標記二個狀態，但你仍然能夠行動。<br/>
<tag>若失敗</tag>，你深陷危機。標記所有你還沒有標記的狀態。你的身體狀況相當糟糕，且如果你不盡快得到真正的幫助，那麼你很可能無法活著回去。

祝好運，夥計，你會需要它的。

最親愛的,<br/>
你的GM
</div>

你也可以使用情書來立即設置出故事情境。當你打算把《蒙面少俠》運行成只持續一場聚會的單發團，而非跨越好幾次聚會的戰役時，這會是相當合適的手段。

親愛的 酷牛姐：

如常創建你的角色，但你〈蠻牛之心〉的起始角色身分為【保衛者】。

你並不知道你真正的名字叫什麼。你也不清楚你來自何方。你可能是從實驗試管中誕生；你可能患了失憶症；你或許是個克隆體、是個秘密機器人、或種種數不盡的可能。你心中有一部份的你並不想要找出答案……但另一部份卻渴望知道真相。

那些帶著怪異光線槍，穿著黑色裝甲的傢伙們，他們來找你好幾次了。而最近這一次襲擊的結果尤其糟糕。你很確定他們動真格了──他們打算活捉你，而不是殺你──但這一次，他們對著這座城市和你身邊的人們伸出了魔爪。看起來他們已經知道你其實很在意是否有人受傷……

讓我們來看看究竟發生了什麼事。擲<b>+危險</b>。

<tag>擲出10+時</tag>, 選擇二項。<br/>
<tag>擲出7-9時</tag>, 選擇一項。<br/>

- 你很快打倒了他們，受傷的人很少──若你希望，提升你的救助屬性，並降低任意其他標籤屬性。
- 你抓住了其中一個傢伙，並威嚇他開口──這對你來說是頭一遭，但你終於有了一個關於幕後黑手的線索。
- 你沒有讓他們影響到你；如果你沒有選擇這個選項，則你標記憤怒狀態。

<tag>若失敗</tag>, 糟糕透頂。你贏了，但人們受了傷……他們還趁機在你身上放置了追蹤器，而你一直到現在，當他們再次衝著你來的時候，你才發現這件事！標記憤怒和另一個你選擇的狀態。

希望你能夠好好應付他們！

最親愛的,<br/>
你的GM

## 更進一步
There are tons of custom moves you can make to hone and focus your game
of MASKS—the game is a framework that’s plenty strong enough to manage your
permutations. But you can push it hard, too, creating custom moves that really
push the game into whole new directions.

Here are a few examples of some big changes you can make with custom
moves in MASKS.

<div class='Move'>
<h4>可消耗的影響力</h4>

當你獲得對某人的影響力時，拿取一個代幣。你可以拿取多個對同一個角色的影響力代幣。你可以消耗你的影響力代幣以：
- 對該角色進行的動作獲得+1加值
- 對該角色造成一個狀態
- 詢問該角色一個問題；他必須誠實回答
- (對PC) 調動該角色的標籤屬性：提升一個，降低一個
- (對PC) 提供該角色標記潛能的機會：如果他按你所說的去做，則他標記一點潛能
- (對PC) 讓該角色在對你進行的動作中承受-2減值
</div>

This change will have repercussions all over the system, so if you go with
it, you’ll have to tweak a bunch of other moves a bit. The ultimate effect,
though, is that Influence becomes more of a spendable resource, something
you accumulate and then use. It makes the game much more directly about
emotional manipulation and leverage—most likely, a game with these rules
would be darker and more cynical.

<div class='Move'>
<h4>自訂狀態</h4>

當你獲得狀態時，寫下一個詞或短語來表現這個折磨著你的情緒狀態。當你進行任何動作時，若這個狀態會阻礙你，則你承受-1減值。當其他PC能夠利用你的狀態，則他們在對你進行任何動作時都將獲得+1加值，然而，他們必須真的能在敘事中利用你的狀態才能獲得這個好處。

如果你在故事中採取了適當的行動來舒緩你的狀態，則你可以將它清除。
</div>

Custom conditions allow for a much wider array of descriptions of
the emotions the PCs undergo, and they give you a lot more freedom in
interpreting when a condition actually affects the situation. But they also lose
a lot of their focus and tightness—you no longer have clear situations in which
the condition does or doesn’t matter, and you lose the clear path to removing
the condition.

<div class='Move'>
<h4>傷害軌</h4>

Characters start play with varying numbers of boxes in their harm tracks. PCs always
have six. NPCs have a number equal to their conditions.
When you trade blows with an NPC, inflict one harm on them. As one of your choices
for directly engaging a threat, you can choose to inflict an additional harm. If you use
overwhelming force against a target, you should inflict an additional harm anyway; the
GM tells you when that’s appropriate.
When you take a powerful blow, mark one box on your harm track. If half the boxes
of your harm track are marked, you’re not doing so hot; what once may have been easy
now requires you to unleash your powers. If all boxes on your harm track are marked,
you’re in very bad shape; you’re likely to die without immediate help.
If an NPC ever fills their harm track, they go unconscious. Without help, they’ll die.
The GM can inflict harm as a hard move.
</div>

Maybe you want physical harm to have more meaning in your game.
Adding a set of custom mechanics like this makes everyone pay more attention
to physical damage, and the threat of dying becomes real. The tone of the
game takes a huge swing for darker territory, with death genuinely on the
line, and Danger takes on a much greater significance as beating enemies into
submission becomes a much more straightforward and effective tactic.

<div class='Move'>
<h4>更快的成長發展</h4>

在每次聚會結束時，回答下列三個問題。每有一個「是」的回答，就標記一點潛能。

- 我們是否打敗了一個危險的敵人？
- 我們是否理解了更多關於某個迫近陰謀的情報？
- 我們是否像一個團隊一樣彼此連結？
</div>
This kind of change may seem pretty small, ultimately, but it plays into
many of the other economies and balances of MASKS. PCs advance much more
quickly when they often get three more potential at the end of the session.
But this also strongly incentivizes taking those specific actions described in
the move and it takes some emphasis off the existing ways to gain potential—
namely, making moves with lower Labels so you roll a miss.

You could tweak the questions attached to this move to really define the
specific kind of game you’re playing. You could come up with specific questions
for every playbook in your game, if you wanted. All of them would drive play
down particular paths much more strongly, and ensure PCs reach their upper
level advances much sooner.

<div class='Move'>
<h4>團隊值</h4>

The team as a whole gains a Team stat, and a Team track with five boxes.
Your Team stat starts the game at +0. Your Team stat can never go higher than +3
or lower than -2.
Whenever you would add a Team to the pool, mark a box on the track instead. When
you mark the fifth box, clear it and increase your Team stat by +1. Whenever you would
spend a Team from the pool, instead clear one box on the track. If there are no filled boxes
to clear, then decrease your Team stat by -1.
When you help a teammate, roll + Team. On a hit, add +1 to their roll. On a 7-9, clear
one box on the Team track. On a miss, clear one box on the Team track in addition to any
other hard moves.
When you act selfishly, say how your actions ignore or insult your teammates and roll
+ Team instead of your usual Label on any move. After the move is resolved, decrease
the Team stat by -1.
</div>

This is a big change, one that messes with a core economy of the game—
Team. Team is less transitory; increasing the Team score can feel cooler than
just adding Team to the pool. It’s also going to be a lot easier for teammates to
help each other; even when Team’s at +0, PCs will now be able to roll it to help
each other out. The added rules might also slow down the game a bit.
