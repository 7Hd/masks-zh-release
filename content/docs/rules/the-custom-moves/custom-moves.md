# CUSTOM MOVES
At this point, you’ve seen all kinds of moves: basic moves, playbook moves,
team moves, and on and on. Those moves show the flexible nature of MASKS...
and you can take advantage of that flexibility by making your own moves—
**custom moves**—that serve your particular game.

Every move is a bit of mechanics designed to promise that something cool
and fun will happen when it’s triggered. Custom moves let you make new
promises that fit what you want out of your game. You can make your own
game of MASKS, your own version of Halcyon City, honed to your particular
interests through these custom moves. Here’s an example:

<div class='Move'>
When you <b>run through the Exemplars’ combat training simulation</b>, roll + Danger.
On a hit, you impress the Exemplars with your performance; take Influence over one
of them. On a 7-9, you get banged up along the way though; mark a condition, your
choice. On a miss, you break the rules of the simulation or damage the simulation
permanently—and you can count on the Exemplars to let you know everything you
did wrong.
</div>

This move fleshes out the Exemplars and their base. It could be tied to an
arc that involves them—a restoration arc, or maybe a destruction arc aimed at
them—but it doesn’t need to be! You can just add moves like this to spice up
your game, to add flavor and definition and depth to your version of Halcyon
City. It’s a way to ensure that something interesting happens when the players
interact with particular pieces of the setting.


## IMAGINARY STORIES
You can tweak, adjust, and mess with this system endlessly. Don’t be afraid to
try out whatever’s in your head for bigger changes, from setting changes to
major rules tweaks. Make your game of MASKS what you want it to be.

And keep your eyes peeled for the other books in the MASKS line, like the
HALCYON CITY HERALD COLLECTION, MASKS: UNBOUND, and THE SECRETS OF A.E.G.I.S., all of which
will come with plenty of custom moves to give you tools and examples for
your own table. And if you really want to see more, look up other Powered
by the Apocalypse games, like APOCALYPSE WORLD, MONSTERHEARTS, DUNGEON WORLD, and
Magpie Games’s own EPYLLION and URBAN SHADOWS—though be warned, many of
those games have a pretty hard R rating.
