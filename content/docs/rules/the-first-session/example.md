## THE LONG EXAMPLE
Here’s a longer example, building off all the rules and ideas already presented, 
to show you what a game of MASKS looks like in action, where to go after that first 
initial fight, and the kinds of situations that might arise. I call out my thoughts 
throughout the example—what moves I’m making and what principles I’m 
following—so you can get a sense for what it’s like to GM. (See the fight 
example on page 147 for more information specifically on what running a 
fight should look like—this example follows that one chronologically, and that 
one gives you a taste for what the opening fight of your first session might be 
like.)

In this example, I’m running the game for four players:

* The Protégé:  Hornet—Chinese, female, body armor and utility belt—
trained by the armor-wearing vigilante Mantis to be an incredible fighter, Lian 
Song is far more interested in stopping bad people than any of the superhero 
dressings. Played by Joe.
* The Transformed:  Rex—Big, green, scaly, spikey, strong and tough, male—
formerly a regular high school student, Michael Stafford is now dealing with 
his strange visage and abilities, and the suspicion and disgust of everyone 
around him. Played by Matt.
* The Nova:  Fission—Black, male, buzzcut, normal skin, colorful costume—a 
physics genius named Tyler Wallace, on track for an early PhD before that life 
was stolen from him by an experiment that gave him the ability to manipulate 
molecules on an atomic level. Played by Sarah.
* The Outsider:  Skysong—Blue, female, white-haired and -eyed, human 
body, humanizing costume—an alien from another world, Veriskanathensis 
came to Earth to avoid being integrated into her people’s group-mind before 
she was ready, and has come to love it here. Played by Andrea.

This  example  builds  off  their  fight  against  the  Teacher.  They’ve  just 
managed to escape from her twisted trap-realm outside of reality, and have 
arrived back in Halcyon City with an important tool—a piece of the Teacher’s 
“chalk,” something they might be able to use to protect Halcyon City from 
further threats. But no sooner have they dropped into Halcyon City than...


{{< hint info >}}
“So, we see the panel of you guys half stumbling, half falling out of the Teacher’s 
realm, her distorted hand stretching out for you as the portal closes. Then we have 
one panel of the four of you catching your breath, nothing behind you but a brick 
wall...and then we have a panel of all four of you opening your eyes and snapping to 
attention, as we see laser gun barrels lifted up and pointed at you from off-screen.” 
I’m describing like a comic-book (page 128), showing a flow of action and shots.

“Oh, darn,” says Matt. “This isn’t good.”

“Nope! It’s a whole bunch of guys with Rook Industries symbols on their armor, 
pointing energy rifles in your direction. They part, and Rosa Rook—CEO of Rook 
Industries—walks through to stand before you in her red suit.” Throughout the whole 
fight I was thinking between the panels (page 133), wondering what Rosa would be 
doing, and setting this plan into motion seemed the perfect move. So 
now I’m announcing a between-panel threat (page 140). 

“‘We’ll  be  taking  that,’  Rosa  Rook  says,  moving  toward 
Hornet with her hand outstretched. ‘We appreciate you bringing 
this  back  to  us.’”  I’m  making  a  villain  move  (page  144), 
one I’ve chosen before for Rosa Rook—seize power from 
a vulnerable party—because it makes perfect sense that 
Rosa would try to take advantage of the heroes’ relative 
weakness and exhaustion.

“Oh, heck no,” says Joe. “‘I am not letting you get 
your hands on this thing,’ I say. I shift into a fighting 
stance. ‘If you want to take it, you’ll have to come at 
us.’ Is that a provoke?” 

“Nah,”  I  say. “Rosa  was  already  here  with 
security guys, she anticipated a fight. You’re not 
really pushing her buttons with threats. Plus, to 
her, you’re just a kid. She looks down her nose 
at you. ‘You are a child, so I expected a certain 
amount of juvenile bravado, and I am not one to 
overreact. But please understand—I do not want 
to hurt you. Please, hand over the chalk before I am 
forced to show you what my people are prepared to do.’ 
Hornet, she’s totally using her Influence over you to tell 
you who you are. She’s shifting your Mundane up, and 
your Danger down. What do you do?” I’m treating my NPC 
like a hammer (page 133), and telling them who they are or who they should be 
(page 142).

“Blech. I don’t want to accept it, so I guess I’m rejecting (page 80),” says Joe.

“What’s that look like?” I ask. To do it, Hornet has to do it.

“I furrow my brows at her and step forward, like I’m getting ready to fight. Should 
I roll?” I nod, and Joe rolls a 4—a miss! “Oh, no,” says Joe.

“Yeah, that’s the thing,” I say. “You take a step forward to fight, and the security 
guys lift their guns at you, and you hear them hum to life. These are serious enemies, 
Rosa’s probably got even more reinforcements you can’t see, and you’re all tired 
after the fight with Teacher—you’re not sure you can win this one. Mark Afraid, 
and make the shift, Mundane up, Danger down. Because it’s a miss, you get to mark 
potential, too.” I have to resort to the mechanics to tell Joe exactly what to change on 
his character sheet, but for the most part I’m trying to make my move but misdirect 
(page 129)—I’m basing the changes to Hornet’s character sheet in the fiction, so the 
mechanical move looks like it’s bound to the story.

“What are the rest of you doing while this goes on? Skysong, what are you 
doing?” I haven’t heard from Andrea in a bit, so I want to shine the spotlight (page 
146) on her.

“I’m not sure what we should do here—I didn’t want to hand over the chalk, but 
I don’t think we can win this fight. I was willing to follow Hornet’s lead...but Hornet 
looks like she’s faltering, and that makes me uncertain. I come up beside her and 
whisper, ‘Hornet, maybe...maybe you should just give her what she wants. We’re in 
no shape to fight her guys right now.’”

“Perfect. That sounds like it’s a provoke to me; she usually listens to you and 
you’ve got Influence over her. What do you actually want Hornet to do?” I ask.
“I want her to back down and hand over the chalk, so we can get out of here 
safely,” says Andrea.

“Yep. Roll it!” Andrea gets a 12, including the +1 bonus for Influence over Hornet. 

“All right, Hornet, that means you add a Team to the pool if you do it, and you 
have to mark a condition if you don’t.” 

“Can I defend myself here?” asks Joe.

“Well, it’s not really an attack, right?” 

“Ah, gotcha,” says Joe. “Okay, well...then I guess I’ll do it. I hesitate for a second, 
then I hand over the chalk.” 

“‘Wonderful,’ says Rosa. ‘I’m glad to see some humility. Bodes well for the future 
of our city.’ She starts to walk away from you, with her security moving to cover her. 
Hornet, add a Team to the pool for doing what your teammate asked.” I’m playing 
Rosa to her drive (page 131)—to dominate the superhuman resources of Halcyon 
City and beyond. Rosa got what she wanted, and she’s not interested in pursuing 
this any harder, even though I could imagine this turning into an out-and-out fight. 

“Rex, Fission—what are you doing?” I want to shine the spotlight on the other 
characters, because they haven’t done much yet in this scene. One of them might 
start a fight...

“Yeah...I think I’m letting them go,” says Matt. “I’m pretty beat up, I’ve got three 
conditions  marked,  and  I  don’t  really  want  to  make  things  worse.  Plus...it  was 
Skysong who talked us down...so of course I’m listening to her.”

“Cool. What about you, Fission?” 

“I...don’t think I want to fight them, but I don’t think I want to just let them go, 
either. I want to be able to track them. I want to figure out where they’re taking this 
chalk,” says Sarah.

“Oh cool! How would you do that? Is that something you’ve ever done before?” 
I’m asking provocative questions (page 133), in this case about Fission’s powers, 
so I can build on the answers  (page 133) later. 

“I’ll extend my awareness and tweak one of those energy guns just a bit, so it 
starts leaking an energy trail, something I can sense. Right? I’ve got control of stuff 
at the atomic level, so I’ll be able to track it. And no, I don’t think I have done this 
before—it’s one of those applications of my powers I’ve wondered about, but haven’t 
tried,” Sarah says. I’m aware that Fission is a Nova, so his powers generally give a 
fictional justification for at least trying a huge number of things—so even if this 
has never happened before, I’m being a fan of the PCs (page 82) by going with it.

“That’s awesome!” I say. “Roll to unleash your powers, you’re extending your 
senses! You’re doing it subtly, but it’s still an unleash.” Sarah rolls a 9. “So that means 
you can either mark a condition, or it’s temporary or unstable,” I say.

“Wait, can I spend a Team out of the pool to help ()?” asks Joe. 

“How would you do that? Fission is doing something pretty specific to his crazy 
powers, and he’s trying to keep it on the downlow,” I say. I’m not against the idea, but 
we’ve got to follow the fiction.

“Ah, yeah. Hmmm. Can we say that I’ve been helping Fission figure out some of 
the things he can do? We’ve been training together, after all,” Joe asks.

“Yeah!” says Sarah. “So maybe I figured out that I can do this during one of those 
training sessions.” 

“Yep, and I recognize what you’re doing, the little flares of energy from your 
fingertips. To do it, though, I have to help you get into a meditative state that Mantis 
taught me. So I start chanting quietly towards you, ‘Close your eyes, clear your mind, 
focus yourself, be empty,’ and so on. So that’s what I’m doing right now, trying to help 
Fission focus,” says Joe.

“Yeah, that’s cool! Spend one Team out of the pool: that makes Fission’s roll a 
10.” I’m playing to find out what changes  (page 126), and I like this—it adds a 
relationship and partnership between Fission and Hornet that wasn’t clearly there 
before. Yeah, it’s a bit of a retcon, but it fits with the fiction we’ve established, it’s 
interesting, and it’s allowing for a cool thing right now.

“Okay! So there’s an energy trail that you can follow, Fission. When you decide to 
pursue it, chances are good it’ll take you to wherever they put the chalk—although 
that doesn’t mean it’ll be undefended.” I’m following the fiction here, but I’m also 
revealing the future, subtly (page 140). I’m flagging to the players that they should 
expect a fight if they go after the chalk.

“In the meantime, though, you guys sound pretty beat. What are you doing now, 
Rex?” Matt hasn’t done much during this conversation, so I want to make sure he 
gets some spotlight.

“Hm. I think I wanted to talk to Skysong about what happened, and stuff in 
general. Y’know. Also, because I have that crush on her,” says Matt.

“Perfect!” Rex is taking action, so I don’t have to make another move here. If he 
hadn’t proposed this scene, and all the PCs just wanted to rest for the night, I would 
cut to some later moment and make a move again, but I don’t have to. “I’ll cut to 
that scene, but I want to make it clear where everyone else is going. Hornet?” I ask.

“Ah, I’d probably go file a report with Mantis—she likes reports after I go into any 
other extradimensional realm—and then I’m going to hit the sack,” says Joe.

“Awesome. What about you, Fission?” 

“Same general idea. I’m going back to our base, taking a shower, and then going 
to sleep.”

“And Skysong? Rex is going to try to talk to you, but where would that be?”

“Oh, after today’s stress, I’m going to make myself hot chocolate—truly, the 
greatest of all Earth drinks—and chill out on the couch.”

“Awesome! And that’s the end of the scene—check to see if you cleared any 
conditions by taking action during that scene.” 

“Does letting Rosa Rook have the chalk count as running from something 
difficult?” asks Joe.

“Absolutely!” I say. “You were basically postponing your conflict with her, at least 
in part out of fear. Clear Afraid (page 88).” 

After everybody else checks and clears any appropriate conditions, I start to set 
the next scene…
