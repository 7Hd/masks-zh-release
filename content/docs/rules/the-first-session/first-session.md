## BEFORE THE FIRST SESSION
Time for your first session! The beginning of your adventures in Halcyon City! 
There will be plenty of robo dinosaurs in your future, I assure you!

Your first session will involve a lot of character creation. That’ll be the 
players’ job. You, on the other hand, are responsible for setting up their first 
adventurous forays into Halcyon City’s superhuman world. 

Here’s what you need to do to make that first session go smoothly. 

#### MATERIALS AND PREP
Print out every playbook you’re using in the game and make sure you’ve got at 
least passing familiarity with each one. Limiting what you offer to the players 
changes the nature of the game a bit—for example, if you want a lighter game, 
don’t offer the Doomed—so think carefully about which playbooks you’re 
offering.

Print out the other necessary sheets for the game, including a basic moves 
sheet for every player. Grab some index cards or post-its, pencils, and dice. You 
can find the sheets you need to print online at www.magpiegames.com/masks. 

Read through this book before you get to the table. You don’t have to 
go  through  every  inch  of  THE MASKS  (page  93)  or  THE FUTURE  (page  113),  but 
definitely skim them. HOOKS AND ARCS (page 181) is most important after your 
first session, but it can give you some good things to look out for during this 
first game. 

Depending on how much time you have at the table, you might want to 
prep a villain in advance. If you can make a villain at the table, connected to 
the PCs and their issues, you should try to do that—but if time’s a factor, come 
to the table with one ready. You can even put the villain out there and ask the 
players to come up with a connection to them during character creation.


## STARTING THE FIRST SESSION
You’ve got your crew assembled—huzzah! Now it’s time for character creation.

Spread out the playbooks and give a brief overview of each. If you’ve got 
the time and want to get in the mood, you can have players dramatically 
read the flavor text out loud. Answer any questions that come up, and make 
suggestions to players as you ask them what issues interest them. Make clear 
that choosing a playbook is more about choosing the issues and themes their 
character will focus on than anything else. Refer to THE HEROES (page 39) for 
more information on how to create characters.

In particular, draw your players’ attention to the pieces of each playbook 
they’re likely to skim over—their Moments of Truth and their team moves. 
Those can tell them a lot about the kind of character they’re playing, so make 
sure they see them up front. 

Encourage the players to talk about their choices out loud, to build up 
excitement and share input on each other’s stuff. No pressure, though—each 
player can create their character through whatever process best suits them. 
Once almost everyone’s done, start character introductions, going around the 
table one at a time, with each player explaining who their character is, what 
they look like, what they can do, and the answers to their backstory questions.

#### ASKING PROBING QUESTIONS
Players don’t introduce their characters in a monologue. Like everything else 
in MASKS, it’s a conversation; ask questions throughout. Explore their characters, 
and your version of Halcyon City, with pointed questions aimed at fleshing out 
their explanations. 

{{< hint info >}}
Rich is introducing his character, Huma the Legacy, to the group (for more about 
Huma’s  character  creation  process  see  THE HEROES,  page  40).  He  explains  that  the 
greatest  story  of  his  legacy  is  when  his  dad  defeated 
Vortex single-handedly, after Vortex had beefed himself 
up using neutron star matter. 

“Tell me a bit more,” I say. “Why did your dad 
have to fight Vortex alone? Wouldn’t other teams 
have been on the scene?”

“Yeah, but Vortex was so overpowered, 
he  just sucked  them all into his own 
personal black hole,” says Rich. “Dad 
managed to knock out Vortex, then 
fly  in  there  and  pull  all  the  other 
heroes out.”

“That’s awesome! So your 
dad not only stopped the bad 
guy,  but  saved  everyone  as 
well!” I say. “Can you name 
one or two of the heroes he 
saved?” I’m trying to get the 
names of a few other possible 
NPCs,  while  also  fleshing  out 
some of the important people in 
our Halcyon City.

“Yeah, how about...I don’t know...let’s go with Fastball and Red Eagle,” Rich says. 
“Excellent!” 

Rich continues, saying the city widely has a positive impression of the Huma 
legacy. 

“Yeah, totally. What about other heroes, though? Folks like Fastball and Red 
Eagle? Are they grateful? Jealous? Awed?” I ask.

“Oh, I like that it isn’t positive. Let’s go jealous, actually. They didn’t love my dad,” 
Rich says.

“Why’s that? What did your dad do that really got their ire up, and how did you, 
Huma, find out about it?”

“I saw an exchange between them at the house. They yelled at Dad, claiming that 
he took credit for what they’d done.” 

“Did you hear any details?”

“No, I don’t think I did. To this day, I still kind of wonder about that.” 

“Awesome!” I say. “Please continue!”
{{< /hint >}}

In general, you can work with generalized answers and drill down to 
specifics later—after all, it’s a classic trope of comic book fiction that characters’ 
full backstories only really get fleshed out over time, through flashbacks and 
whatnot. 

That said, if you feel like you need more information from their answers, 
their answers are probably non-specific, based on generalities, big loaded 
terms, or ambiguous details. Drill down to specifics when you feel like you 
need more information. When a player says, “My dad was a criminal,” ask 
“What did he do? Why did he do it?” When a player says, “The city generally 
thinks I’m pretty good,” ask “Why? What did you do that earned their trust? 
What does it look like, that they think you’re pretty good? Action figures? 
News reports?”

## DURING THE FIRST SESSION
Your goals in your first session are to: 

* Help your players create their characters
* Prime Halcyon City with plenty of cool material and events to build on
* Show off who these characters are
* Go through most of the mechanics of the game (and definitely all the basic moves)
* Create an awesome first issue of your comic 

That first session, a fair amount of your time will be eaten up by character 
creation. Usually, it takes about one or two hours if you’re asking questions and 
exploring each character to get to your first scenes. 

Once the characters are created, take a break and prepare a villain if you 
don’t  have  one  already  (page  155).  Pull  in  a  villainous  character  they’ve 
already set up, or create one tied into at least one PC—it’s important to have a 
cool villain for an awesome opening sequence. Create a villain you’re excited 
to show off!

Dive  right  in  with  an  opening  scene  that’s  all  about  a  fight.  Frame  it 
evocatively as a comic book. Describe panels that show off different parts of 
the city before zooming in on your chosen location for the fight. Then show 
off the villain destroying something, causing mayhem, pursuing their drive. 
Finally, go to each PC one at a time, and ask them how they enter the scene, 
allowing them to play up how cool they are. Maybe let them make one move, 
but keep this limited—you want to get all the PCs into the scene before any of 
them start doing too much.

Once they’re all in the scene, trigger when you enter battle against a 
dangerous foe as a team (page 84) to prime the Team pool with some points 
for them to use. Then go to town. Have an awesome, fun fight scene—but try 
not to take up the rest of the session with it. Remember your villain’s drive: 
they might try to run away if things turn against them. 

Try to get to the aftermath of the fight, if at all possible. Shift to heroes 
showing  up  and  judging  the  PCs’  performance;  to  the  PCs’  loved  ones 
commenting  on  the  events  of  the  battle;  to  the  PCs  sharing  triumphant 
celebrations or secrets and vulnerabilities, or comforting and supporting each 
other. 

If  possible,  you  want  your  first  session  to  hit  at  least  the  following 
mechanics:

* Every basic move, including take a powerful blow, at least once
* Label shifts and rejecting Influence
* Conditions, taking them and removing them 

Here are some other key things you want to try to do in your first session:
* Bring on the action
* Build on character creation
* Ask questions constantly
* Call out moves when they happen
* Offer moves when the players flinch
* Frame scenes with multiple characters
* Shift their Labels
* Display the adaptations to the superhuman
* Give them a chance to talk

### BRING ON THE ACTION
A huge part of MASKS is superheroic action—explosions! Punches! Flying people! 
Kirby crackle! Energy bolts! Since you’re opening with a big fight against a 
villain, you should have plenty of opportunity to bring on that awesome action. 
Take advantage of it. Play up the tension of it, and the fun of it. Keep the pace 
up early, and slow it down after the action scene is over.

### BUILD ON CHARACTER CREATION
The more you reincorporate elements the players have introduced during 
character creation, the better. You’ve got a limited time to do it, but make 
connections and incorporations as best you can. When you need to include 
an endangered civilian, go for one of the NPCs introduced during character 
creation. When you need to include a villain, go for someone they’ve fought 
before or have a relationship with. 

### ASK QUESTIONS CONSTANTLY
Never stop asking for more details throughout the whole first session. Any time 
a question occurs to you about the fiction, ask it. “What happens to villains 
after you paste them into the ground?” “Oh, have you ever done that with your 
powers before? Did you know you could?” “Why would your mom be here, 
downtown? Why wouldn’t she be running from the Blue Hydra?” Those details 
give you more to play within the setting, especially when you build arcs after 
the first session.

### CALL OUT MOVES WHEN THEY HAPPEN
You’re trying to show off all the basic moves, so be on the lookout for instances 
when a player triggers one of them. At the very start of play, the other players 
will probably need a bit more help to pick out when they’re triggering a move 
or to determine which move they’re triggering. Model it early and call it out 
to them, asking, “It sounds like you’re trying to _______, right?” If they want 
to trigger a particular move, help them out by asking, “Cool! What does that 
look like on the page?”

### OFFER MOVES WHEN THE PLAYERS FLINCH
In general, don’t tell players what to do—leave their actions up to them. But 
in this first session, offer some suggestions about moves they might make, 
especially when they seem hesitant to commit. Always phrase it as a question, 
based on the fiction—”Toro, you’re super strong, right? When Rampage is 
pushing this bus at you, do you think you’d want to just tear through it—maybe 
unleash your powers? Or maybe you want to slow her to a stop by defending 
the people in the bus?”

### FRAME SCENES WITH MULTIPLE CHARACTERS
Your opening scene is definitely going to include multiple characters—the 
whole team should be in that initial fight. But as the fight ends, continue to 
frame scenes with at least two PCs in them, if not more. Try not to have the 
PCs splinter into solo scenes. If the Protégé’s mentor berates them, do it in 
front of another PC! It’s the first session, and you want to give them a chance 
to interact with each other and trigger moves like defend someone or comfort 
or support someone.

### SHIFT THEIR LABELS
From the get-go, use the NPCs’ Influence over the PCs to try to shift their 
Labels. Have the villain tell them who they are—”You’re nothing! You can’t 
possibly stand up to me!” is a classic—and then make them accept or reject 
that Influence. The earlier the players get used to the idea that other characters 
can change their Labels, adjusting them up or down, the better.

### DISPLAY THE ADAPTATIONS TO THE SUPERHUMAN
Show off Halcyon City’s superhuman side in this first session. Remind the 
players of the past generations of superhumans with statues and monuments 
around the city. Call out that people are probably used to these kinds of attacks, 
so they have drills and shelters. In the aftermath, describe the expert clean-
up crews moving away rubble. Give the players a sense of place by putting 
Halcyon City’s adaptations into your panels.

### GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO TALK
Alongside  the  need to frame scenes with  multiple  characters  is  the  need 
to actually let them interact with each other. Don’t try to make everything 
about NPCs pushing at the PCs—let them bounce off one another. Prod 
them sometimes—suggest ways they might clear conditions by messing with 
each other, or suggest moves they might make in their interactions with each 
other—but let them just have some time to interact directly. MASKS is about the 
team, so give the heroes some time to be a team.

## AFTER THE FIRST SESSION
When you’re done with the first session, you’ll have a good idea of who these 
characters are and what they’re interested in. You’ll have plenty of NPCs to play 
with, and you’ll have backstories to draw on. Let these elements percolate, and 
start asking yourself questions to draw them together. You’re going to use these 
pieces to build your character issues, your hooks, and your arcs—see HOOKS AND 
ARCS for more (see page 181).

Remember that you’re not about to come up with the full plot for the next 
few sessions—you’re creating the tools that will help you structure the next 
sessions, but you’re always going to play to find out what happens and what 
changes.
