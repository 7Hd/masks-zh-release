## 成年英雄動作
The adult superheroes of Halcyon City can do things the younger heroes can’t 
quite pull off. As the younger heroes grow in confidence, power, and ability, 
their capabilities mature. 

Adult moves are essentially more powerful versions of the basic moves. 
But they don’t actually replace the basic moves—just because you can now 
overwhelm a vulnerable foe, that doesn’t mean you can’t directly engage a 
threat.

## WIELD YOUR POWERS

When you<b> wield your powers</b> with precision or grace, roll<b>+Freak</b>。
roll + Freak. 

<tag>若成功</tag>，選擇一項。<br/>
<tag>擲出10+時</tag>，選擇二項。<br/>

* take hold of something vulnerable to you
* create something useful from your environment
* neutralize an opponent or threat, at least for now
</div>
{{< details title="〈直面威脅〉詳述" >}}
Unleashing your powers is trying something you’re not sure you can really 
pull off, whereas wielding your powers is doing something with mastery and 
control, so you get exactly the effect you want. Just like unleashing your powers, 
wielding them doesn’t trigger every time you use your abilities; you still have 
to wield them to a particular effect, and you have to do it with a focus or grace 
beyond the most ordinary uses of your abilities. 

#### 關於〈行使你的力量〉的選項
To take hold of something vulnerable to you, you seize something, physically 
or metaphorically. You could literally snatch something out of an enemy’s 
hands with your telekinesis, or you could take control of the genius loci in the 
Halcyon Park, or you could take hold of your enemies’ fear by putting on a 
terrifying show of power. You name what you want to take hold of before you 
make the move, and the GM tells you if it’s vulnerable to you. 

To create something useful from your environment, just name something 
within your abilities to make, and you do it. This could be anything from 
“a hole in the wall” to “a living statue” depending on your abilities and the 
environment around you. It’s always explicitly useful to you,—if you create a 
living statue, it’ll fight for you or defend you, not cause you trouble.

To neutralize an opponent or threat, at least for now, name what you hope 
to neutralize, and so long as it’s within your abilities to do so, that opponent 
or threat is locked down, incapacitated, or otherwise indisposed. This could 
be anything from encasing an enemy in ice to shooting a flashbang arrow in 
their face. It’s always temporary—they’ll recover, given time—but it may give 
you the opportunity you need to take them down, or to run.

## OVERWHELM A VULNERABLE FOE

When you <b>overwhelm a vulnerable foe</b>, roll <b>+Danger</b>。

<tag>若成功</tag>，the fight’s over. They’re done.。<br/>
<tag>擲出10+時</tag>，選擇一項。<br/>
<tag>擲出7-9時</tag>，選擇二項。

* you take a powerful blow in turn
* you hurt your foe more than you intended
* you cause serious collateral damage
</div>
{{< details title="〈制服弱勢敵人〉詳述" >}}
This is a powerful move—it’s a way for a PC to instantly end a fight against a foe, 
regardless of how many conditions they have marked. You open fire, pouring 
attack after attack on an enemy and just battering them into submission. 

The key to this move is “vulnerable foe.” Dangerous opponents almost 
certainly won’t be vulnerable, at least until they’ve been pushed a bit—maybe 
the PC tricks them into making a stupid move, or maybe they’ve gotten banged 
up first. But until the PC has a real chance against them to end things quickly, 
they can’t trigger the move. 

“The fight’s over” means exactly that. Against this enemy, at least, the fight 
is over. They’re knocked down, knocked out, defeated, incapable of continuing.

#### 關於〈制服弱勢敵人〉的選項
Choosing to take a powerful blow in turn is exactly what it says—you have to 
roll to take a powerful blow. Your enemy, though they’re vulnerable to you, 
gets a shot at you before they go down.

Choosing you hurt your foe more than you intended means your dangerous 
nature overcomes your restraint. To overwhelm a vulnerable foe, you’ve really 
got to lay it on them, hard, and it can get out of your control. This is when it 
turns out you accidentally left your psychic opponent a vegetable (at least for 
now), or the massive energy blast you unleashed cost your enemy an arm. 
Depending on your tone and the fiction, it might even mean your enemy dies. 
You can bet that’ll have repercussions, especially when your teammates and 
the adult heroes hear about it. 

Choosing you cause serious collateral damage means your environment, 
and those around you, are hurt or at least endangered. Maybe that torrent of 
blows you unleash damages a support strut, and now the building is collapsing. 
Maybe when you blew up half the street with a radioactive blast, you caught 
your friends in the explosion. It’s up to the GM exactly who or what gets hurt.

## PERSUADE WITH BEST INTERESTS

When you <b>persuade someone with their best interests</b>, roll <b>+Superior</b>。

<b>若對方為NPC：</b><br/>
<tag>擲出10+時</tag>，they buy it and act accordingly.<br/>
<tag>擲出7-9時</tag>，they need concrete assurance right now. 

<b>若對方為PC：</b><br/>
<tag>若成功</tag>，they can mark potential or shift their own Labels if they do what you want.<br/>
<tag>擲出10+時</tag>，take Influence over them as well.
</div>
{{< details title="〈〉詳述" >}}
Provoking someone is about pushing their buttons; persuading them with 
their best interests is about dangling a carrot in front of them and leading 
them where you want. You’re not trying to trick or anger them—you’re offering 
them exactly what they want or need in exchange for them doing what you 
tell them to do. 

Persuading  someone  with  their  best  interests  doesn’t  have  to  be  so 
obviously transactional, either. You don’t have to physically have the thing they 
want—it’s more about you identifying what they want or need and telling them 
what to do to get it. Telling a would-be hero that they really need to stand up 
to the corrupt police department if they want to appear to be a true hero is 
persuading them with their best interests—you’re offering them a path to their 
goals.

Like  provoke,  when  you  trigger  this  move  make  sure  you  say,  out  of 
character, what you want them to do.

#### 關於〈〉的選項
When an NPC needs concrete assurance, they need clearer proof that the path 
you’re offering to them really is in their best interests. You need to provide 
some evidence or support, or make some kind of meaningful promise to back 
up your words, for them to believe what you’re telling them.

For PCs, if you get a hit, they get to choose whether they mark potential 
or shift Labels (and which Labels they shift) if they do what you want. Taking 
Influence over them on a 10+ is in addition to them getting to mark potential 
or shift their Labels.

## EMPATHIZE

When you <b>openly empathize with someone</b>, roll <b>+Mundane</b>.

<tag>若成功</tag>，they must reveal a vulnerability or mark a condition.<br>
<tag>擲出10+時</tag>，take Influence over them as well.
</div>
{{< details title="〈〉詳述" >}}
Openly empathizing with someone is about creating a deeper connection with 
another person, something more than just comforting them. You can comfort 
someone by saying what they want to hear, without ever truly understanding 
them or reaching them. Empathizing with them requires you to address their 
real feelings and situation, meaningfully and directly—not to make them feel 
better, but to connect with them, to reach them.

To trigger this move you must empathize openly, speaking about it out loud 
to let them know. It’s not enough to empathize internally, to think about how 
you understand where the other person is coming from—you have to speak 
to them about it. 

#### 關於〈〉的選項
When you get a hit on empathizing with someone, they choose whether they 
reveal a vulnerability or mark a condition. If they choose to mark a condition, 
they’re keeping themselves closed down, refusing to connect, and doing so 
hurts them emotionally. They choose which condition they mark. 

If they choose to reveal a vulnerability and they’re a PC, it almost certainly 
triggers the appropriate team move on their playbook.

## STAND UP FOR SOMETHING

When you <b>stand up for something</b>, roll <b>+Savior</b>.

<tag>擲出10+時</tag>，選擇一項。<br/>
<tag>擲出7-9時</tag>，選擇二項。

* listeners can’t keep doing what they’re doing
* listeners can’t flee without addressing you
* listeners can’t attack you without losing status or position
</div>
{{< details title="〈〉詳述" >}}
Standing up for something is making heroic speeches in the face of terrible 
opposition, and boldly stating your true beliefs. Standing up for something is 
about defending an ideal in the face of someone who’d tear it down. It lets you 
affect those who listen to you in a broad way, generally preventing them from 
continuing to take action that threatens your ideal.

Standing up for something is most often about your words, what you 
say, and who hears you. That means you don’t necessarily have to do anything 
physical to trigger it—you could stand up for something while tied to a chair.

#### 關於〈〉的選項
Choosing that listeners can’t keep doing what they’re doing means you can 
ensure someone who hears you has to stop what they’re doing to listen to your 
words. If a villain is programming the city-destroying bomb, and you choose 
can’t keep doing what they’re doing, you ensure that they turn their attention 
away from the bomb. What they do next isn’t in 
your control, however.

Choosing  that  listeners  can’t  flee 
without addressing you means that you 
guarantee they face you directly instead 
of running away. They have to directly 
respond  to  what  you’ve  said  before 
they can leave, and that means you get 
another chance to come at them with 
another move, or to keep their attention 
away from anything else.

Choosing that listeners can’t attack you 
without losing status or position means that if they 
choose to come after you, doing so hurts their status or 
position in some way. Status is about how others see 
them, while position is about their actual stance and 
placement. Hurting their status means others view them 
worse,  while  hurting  their  position  means  they  put 
themselves at a disadvantage.
