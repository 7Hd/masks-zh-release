## 成長發展
The main characters in a game of MASKS change drastically over the course of 
the game. Their Labels shift, they gain and lose Influence, and they reach their 
potential. All of these changes are reflected both in elements on the character 
sheets and in the fiction of your game. Like the moves, change in MASKS is both 
fictional and mechanical. 

Sometimes you gain something in the fiction, and it causes you to mark a 
change on your character playbook.

Hornet sends the last punch into Vanquish’s jaw, knocking out the alien dictator, 
while Mantis looks on. There’s no doubt in my mind—she just gained Influence over 
Mantis with that impressive display, and I tell Joe to mark it down.

For his service to the strange alien Crafters, Sureshot gets a new energy bow, 
something that never runs out of ammunition and can fire energy bolts of myriad 
forms. I tell Mark he should probably record the new bow as a different ability with 
something like energy control.

Sometimes, you lose something in the fiction, and it makes you mark 
something out of your character playbook.

Skysong flies her crystalline ship directly into the skyscraper-sized Dominus to take 
him out once and for all. The maneuver works, the energy discharge from the ship 
sending him to a different dimension...but I tell Skysong to mark the ship off her 
sheet. She doesn’t have it anymore—it shattered when it struck him.

Dusk learned she could take away Lady Faust’s powers while meditating in her 
Penumbra sanctum, but she’d consume the power of the sanctum entirely. In the final 
fight with Lady Faust, Grace decides to go through with the plan, channeling all the 
power of Penumbra into Lady Faust to blast away her demonic might. I tell Grace to 
cross the sanctum off her playbook.

Reaching your potential and taking advances works in the other direction. 
You take the advance mechanically, then you have to work out how it fits into 
the fiction. Chances are, you and the GM will have to work together to make 
sense of the change. The key, though, is that you don’t need permission to take 
an advance—you can take it whenever you want, and while you might need 
to work out a compromise about the fiction to make the advance make sense, 
ultimately you always get whatever you take. 

{{< hint info >}}
Rex and the team just fought off a bunch of time-displaced dinosaurs, and Rex got an 
advance thanks to a few misses during the fight. Matt really likes the idea of getting a 
pet raptor, so he takes the advance Get a move from another playbook and chooses 
C’mon, Lucky from the Beacon playbook. That means he gets some kind of smaller 
companion that helps him out on some moves. 

I think that’s awesome. I tell him that Rex finds an egg from the raptors. I suggest 
that in the fiction, it probably makes sense that the egg won’t hatch a fully grown 
raptor; but especially since it’s a time-displaced raptor, it probably ages rapidly as he 
raises it in the team’s base, and it’ll show up at least by next session. Matt’s cool with 
all that, and writes down the move and his raptor’s name.

Huma rolls a miss trying to pierce his dad’s mask, and it’s the last potential Huma 
needs to advance. Rich immediately decides on Take a sanctuary from the Doomed 
playbook, and suggests there’s a special place, tied to the power of Huma, that his 
family never learned to call on. I think that’s awesome, so as soon as the scene is 
resolved and Huma storms away from his dad, I say that his power calls him to his 
new sanctuary.

### MARKING POTENTIAL
You have to mark potential five times to advance. As soon as you mark the 
fifth, you clear your track and take an advance. Pick one option from the 
advancement list and mark it off—once you’ve taken that particular advance, 
you can’t take it again. Once you’ve taken five from the top list, above the line, 
you can start taking options from below the line. 

There are a few ways to mark potential throughout the game, ranging from 
team moves to some of the results of basic moves, but the most important way 
is by rolling a miss on any move. Every time you roll a miss, on any move, 
you mark potential.

### 成長發展選項
大部分的成長發展選項都相當直接明瞭，但我們還是在這裡寫下一些關於它們各自代表意義的說明。
<div class='Move'>
<ul>
    <li>從你的扮演書獲得另一個動作</li>
    <li>從其他扮演書中獲得另一個動作</li>
</ul>
</div>
You get another move, either from your own playbook or from a different one, 
depending on which advance you choose. This is for getting another move, not 
an extra—you can’t take the doom track from the Doomed, for instance, by 
taking a move from another playbook.

####

<div class='Move'>
<ul>
    <li>某個人將永遠失去對你的影響力；選擇一個標籤屬性＋１</li>
</ul>
</div>
Pick one character; they lose Influence over you if they have it, and they 
can never gain Influence over you again, by any means. If they would ever gain 
Influence over you, ignore that part of the move or effect. 

After you choose that character, add +1 to any one of your Labels. Note that 
this isn’t a shift, meaning that another Label doesn’t have to move down. You 
simply move that Label up one. It might shift down later, like normal, but the 
overall total of your Labels is permanently increased by one.

####

<div class='Move'>
<ul>
    <li>重新分配你的標籤屬性；並選擇一個標籤屬性＋１</li>
</ul>
</div>
As soon as you pick this advance, you can reassign the points in your 
Labels however you choose, shifting any of them up and down as much as 
you want, so long as the overall total of all your Labels doesn’t change. After 
you’re finished shifting however you want, add +1 to a single Label. Just like 
the advance above, this isn’t a shift. That Label goes up by 1, and no other Label 
has to come down.

####

<div class='Move'>
<ul>
    <li>解鎖你的「關鍵時刻」</li>
    <li>在使用過「關鍵時刻」之後，再次解鎖它</li>
</ul>
</div>
When you take this advance, you unlock your Moment of Truth. When you 
trigger it, you follow the script listed in your playbook and take control of what 
happens in the narrative (page 47). After you’ve triggered it once, it becomes 
“locked” again, and you have to take the second advance to unlock it again.

The second advance is listed below the line, so you can only take it after 
you’ve already taken five advances. Even if you change playbooks, you can 
only take this advance once, after you’ve already unlocked and triggered your 
playbook’s Moment of Truth.

####

<div class='Move'>
<ul>
    <li>為你的〈蠻牛之心〉再選擇二個角色身分</li>
    <li>解鎖三個新的耀焰</li>
    <li>從你的導師那裏再選擇最多四個資源</li>
</ul>
</div>
These  advances  get  you  more  options  for  the  base  elements  of  your 
playbook. When you take them, you get those additional options immediately, 
selected from those already present. 

####

<div class='Move'>
<ul>
    <li>任意二個標籤屬性＋１</li>
    <li>你導師體現或否定的標籤屬性＋２</li>
    <li>改變你〈面具〉的標籤屬性；你〈面具〉新的標籤屬性＋１</li>
</ul>
</div>
These advances increase your overall Label totals. Adding +1 to any two 
Labels means that you increase any two Labels by one step, without shifting 
anything down. Adding +2 to the Label your mentor embodies or denies is a 
Protégé advance, and it requires you to add the +2 specifically to either the 
Label that your mentor embodies or denies, and no others. Changing your 
Mask Label and adding +1 to the new Mask Label is a Janus advance, and 
represents you changing your mind about who you are, how you see yourself 
and your mask. 

Remember that each individual Label can never be higher than +3.


####

<div class='Move'>
<ul>
    <li>獲得明燈扮演書中的「驅動力」</li>
    <li>獲得蠻牛扮演書中的「蠻牛之心」</li>
    <li>獲得命帶天劫者扮演書中的「避難聖所」</li>
    <li>你適應了人類的生活；獲得雙面人扮演書中的「祕密身分」和〈面具〉動作</li>
    <li>獲得命帶天劫者扮演書中的「末日」、「末日軌」和「末日徵兆」</li>
</ul>
</div>
These advances allow you to take a specific extra from a different playbook. 
Make your choices and fill in your options as if you were building a character 
of that playbook anew, unless the advance tells you to do something different.

For all these options, make sure you talk with the GM. Taking drives from 
the Beacon might not mean much—maybe you’re just getting more interested 
and excited about living a superheroic life. But if you take a sanctuary, that’s 
got to come from somewhere. If you take a secret identity, you have to explain 
how you can fit in with the mortal population. Work with the GM to answer 
these questions after you take the advance.

####

<div class='Move'>
<ul>
    <li>解鎖你超能力套組中剩下兩個你尚未擁有的超能力</li>
    <li>從任意扮演書中選擇並獲得二個新的超能力</li>
    <li>進一步異變，並獲得二個新的超能力（從其他扮演書選擇）</li>
</ul>
</div>
These  advances  give  you  more  abilities,  Remember  abilities  include 
superpowers and skills, all the cool things that make your character deserving 
of inclusion in your superhero comic book. These advances tell you what 
abilities to choose from—if they tell you to choose from any playbook, then 
select any abilities listed in the other playbooks.

The same general advice and rules from character creation apply here. 
The advance is about you developing new powers and skills, and the abilities 
described in the playbooks generally feed into that idea more consistently and 
successfully than just picking any ability at all—for example, time travel isn’t an 
ability in any of the base playbooks, and will almost always cause more trouble 
than it’s worth. That said, use our own judgment, and talk to your GM and the 
other players. If you have a great idea for an ability that’s not in the playbooks, 
then maybe it can still work out.

### 進階成長發展選項
Some advances are listed in the playbook 
below a line. You can only choose these 
advances  when  you’ve  already  taken 
five advances above the line. These are 
generally  uniform  across  the  different 
playbooks, but a few playbooks have some 
small changes to these advances. 

<div class='Move'>
<ul>
    <li>更換扮演書</li>
</ul>
</div>
Pick a new playbook that no other player is currently using, and switch 
your character over to it. This is a huge change for your PC—they’re now 
confronted with totally different issues, and their situation and life will change 
to match. This is the alien Outsider settling into life on Earth and becoming a 
Janus, concerned more about leading a double life than their alien home. Or 
the noble Legacy being doused in strange chemicals and changing into a weird 
monster, the Transformed, now contending with their grotesque body. 

You get whatever moves the playbook tells you to take, as if you were 
building a new character with that playbook. You also get whatever extras the 
playbook describes. Don’t worry about the “When our team came together for 
the first time…” section, or the Influence or Relationships—those things are 
already set for your character. Keep your Labels exactly the same as they were 
before you switched playbooks, keep any conditions you had marked, keep any 
potential you have currently marked, and keep any Influence you hold over 
other characters. 

Use the advancement track on your new playbook, but transfer any marks 
you’ve made below the line—those advances don’t “refresh” when you change 
playbooks. 

Whether you keep the abilities, moves, and extras of your first playbook 
depends on the exact circumstances of your switch. Generally speaking, you 
keep anything internal to your character—like your emotions or knowledge—
and you lose anything external that doesn’t fit with the new playbook or 
would’ve been lost in the change. 

If you’re the Doomed and you change to a new playbook, you almost 
certainly give up your doom track and doomsigns—you’re not the Doomed 
anymore, and it’s likely those pieces don’t make sense to carry over to your 
new playbook. If you’re the Protégé and you change to a new playbook, you 
probably give up your mentor—your story’s not about your close relationship 
with them anymore. If you’re the Janus, though, you might not actually give up 
your secret identity or your social obligations to become the Beacon. 

It’s  easy  to  imagine  exceptions—a  Protégé  keeping  their  mentor,  but 
becoming part of a larger tradition as they become a Legacy, for example. 
A Janus who abandons their prior life—and their prior powers—as they’re 
forever altered and become the Transformed. 

Talk these pieces over with your GM to decide which you keep and which 
you lose, if any. The key is to be true to the fiction—what would the character 
actually keep, and what would they lose?

####

<div class='Move'>
<ul>
    <li>獲得一個成年英雄動作</li>
</ul>
</div>
When you take this advance, you immediately gain access to one of the 
adult moves (page 119). Keep in mind that you can only take this advance 
twice—you can only ever gain access to two of the five adult moves.

####

<div class='Move'>
<ul>
    <li>固定一個標籤屬性的數值，並選擇一個標籤屬性＋１</li>
</ul>
</div>
Pick one Label and lock it—it can’t move up nor down. If that Label would 
shift, ignore that effect in its entirety.

You also get to add +1 to any Label you choose, remembering that this isn’t 
a shift, but an addition. You can do these effects in any order, meaning you can 
add +1 before you lock the Label—raising it to +3, for example, then locking it. 

####

<div class='Move'>
<ul>
    <li>從生涯退役，或成為城市的典範</li>
</ul>
</div>
When you take this advance, your character is no longer a PC. Regardless 
of whether you choose to have them retire or become a paragon, their story, 
as far as MASKS is concerned, is over. 

If your PC retires, they stop being a superhero, at least in the traditional 
sense. Maybe they go off to college, maybe they form a company around their 
super science ideas, maybe they venture off into the galaxy to explore the 
cosmos—regardless, they stop being a costumed superhero in Halcyon City. 
What’s more, they’re guaranteed safety—the GM can’t later mess with them 
specifically in any way. 

If your PC becomes a paragon, they become one of the leading heroes of 
Halcyon City—essentially, they become one of the adults. Even if they’re not 
public, they’re still embedded deeply in the fabric of the city. Work with the 
GM to figure out exactly what that looks like for the character. They transition 
into an NPC, and the GM has a responsibility to avoid targeting them. They’re 
presumed to be having their own adventures, conflicts, and battles, but they’re 
not the focus of the story anymore.

After you choose this advance, if you’re still playing your MASKS campaign, 
pick up a new playbook and make a new character. 



## 創建新的角色
When  you  make  a  new  character  during  an 
ongoing campaign—most important when your old 
character retires or becomes a paragon—the process 
is mostly the same, aside from a few key differences.

Ignore  your  “When  the  team  first  came 
together…” section. The team is already together, so 
that question won’t matter. Instead, work out why 
you’re joining the team, why the team already trusts 
you, and why they want you to join their group.

Ignore your Influence section. Pick at least two PCs whose words matter to 
you. Give them Influence over you. 

For Relationships, fill them in with other PCs as normal.

After you’ve introduced your character, go around the table and ask each 
PC if they care what you think. If they do, they give you Influence over them. 
If they don’t, ask them to tell you one time they shot you down.
