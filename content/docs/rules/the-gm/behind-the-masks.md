# BEHIND THE MASKS 
The  playbooks  your  players  choose  tell  you  more  than  just  their  specific 
abilities and moves—they tell you the issues and themes your players are 
interested in seeing during the game. That may change over the course of play; 
it might turn out that the Doomed is surprisingly interested in their romantic 
interest, or that the Outsider is actually interested in their dual identity. But 
those playbooks flag what kind of conflicts the players want to see in the game. 

As much as possible, keep in mind what moves and options they select—
those options give you further clues about what they want to see during play. 
But don’t worry about this too much. Ultimately, the players are in charge of 
their own characters and making their moves come into play. 

Pay close attention to the contents of this section: the playbook moves. 
Each playbook comes with a few GM moves, catered to that playbook’s specific 
issues and elements. Use these moves when you could make any other move to 
drive attention to those thematic pieces of each character.
