# BEHIND THE MASKS 
The  playbooks  your  players  choose  tell  you  more  than  just  their  specific 
abilities and moves—they tell you the issues and themes your players are 
interested in seeing during the game. That may change over the course of play; 
it might turn out that the Doomed is surprisingly interested in their romantic 
interest, or that the Outsider is actually interested in their dual identity. But 
those playbooks flag what kind of conflicts the players want to see in the game. 

As much as possible, keep in mind what moves and options they select—
those options give you further clues about what they want to see during play. 
But don’t worry about this too much. Ultimately, the players are in charge of 
their own characters and making their moves come into play. 

Pay close attention to the contents of this section: the playbook moves. 
Each playbook comes with a few GM moves, catered to that playbook’s specific 
issues and elements. Use these moves when you could make any other move to 
drive attention to those thematic pieces of each character. 


### THE BEACON
* Draw attention to their inadequacies
* Praise their best traits
* Make them pay for their audacity
* Compare them to the others
* Play to their drives

The Beacon is about being the “straight man” to everybody else’s crazy, over-
the-top superhero. They’re normal, through and through, and there’s a strong 
argument to be made they shouldn’t be with this team—and it’s your job, as 
GM, to make that argument. Put pressure on the Beacon to prove why they 
belong. Doubt them. Make them insecure. And then give them chances to 
shine, doing whatever it is they do best. Pay attention to the Beacon’s drives—
those tell you what the Beacon is hoping to do, and you should try your best 
to help the Beacon mark them off, at least one per session.


### THE BULL
* Endanger their love
* Bolster their rival
* Reveal dark secrets of their past
* Attack with someone just like them
* Swarm with mundane forces

The Bull is hyperfocused on their love and rival, by default. Go with that. 
Play  up  those  relationships.  Make  their  love  endangered,  and  their  rival 
bolstered, to give them chances to react. Sometimes, flip it to keep things 
interesting—endanger  their  rival  and  bolster  their  love  (maybe  with  a 
competing love interest). 

The Bull comes from some dark past, some weapons program, something 
that made them so destructive. Bring that up, and don’t ever let them totally 
forget what they are, especially by using villains and other enemies just like 
them, or by swarming them with mundane forces to watch them prove what a 
weapon they are when they overcome.


### THE DELINQUENT
* Put them in chains
* Give or take an audience
* Give them conditional love
* Show them the line
* Offer a helping hand

The Delinquent is likely to be a rebel without a cause as well as a performer 
looking for an audience. They’re cynical and sarcastic, yet desirous of honest, 
naïvely positive relationships. Play to all sides of their character. Restrict them 
with rules so they can break free, but also offer them support and help tie them 
up with relationships too. 

Sometimes, put them in front of an audience of watchers who love their 
antics; other times, take away that audience and leave them cold and alone. 
Give them love, but only by attaching a price to it, and never let them forget 
that there are powers above them setting the rules and boundaries. 


### THE DOOMED
* Mark their doom track
* Offer a chance to further their cause
* Remind them of what they could lose
* Push them to the brink
* Offer temporary relief with a cost

The  Doomed  is  fatalistic  and  grim. Adding  a  Doomed  to  your  game 
inherently puts death on the table, and makes your entire game a bit darker. 
Don’t ever let them forget that they’re doomed. Have other characters reference 
it, add bits of description about it to the fiction, and make them mark their 
doom track. 

Show them the best of the people around them, people who care about 
them—make them want to stay here in this world. All the while, edge the 
Doomed closer and closer to the brink, hitting them hard, so they have to 
resort to their doomsigns and other resources for victory. Try to remember 
their conditions for advancing their doom track, so you can make moves 
toward those.

For the doomsign Infinite Powers , make sure they know they can take 
an ability from another playbook for a one-time action—not a move from 
another playbook. 

Talk to them to make sure you have a joint understanding of what the 
triggers that advance their doom track look like. And don’t worry about giving 
them a final confrontation with their doom. If it makes sense in the fiction, 
give them the opportunity to overcome it, but they’ll have to contend with their 
doom, one way or another, thanks to their advances.


### THE JANUS
* Bring their obligations to bear
* Endanger someone from either life
* Make their lives cross over
* Put more obligations on them
* Take away their mask

The Janus is about the double life, the nature of having two identities. Push 
them on it. You’re in charge of saying when time passes, so you’re in charge 
of saying when the Janus has to roll for their social obligations—don’t skimp 
on it. Continually ask them which life they’re in. If someone doesn’t know the 
identity they’re currently in, ask the Janus if the Influence they hold over that 
person would really apply. 

Make both lives tough. Their superheroic life is obviously difficult, because 
the team as a whole will be mixed up in crazy drama. But they need specific 
pushing from their mundane life and the obligations therein. Have those in 
their mundane life lay obligations upon them. Put the people in their mundane 
life in danger as much as those in their superheroic life. 

Give the people in their mundane life opinions on the people in their 
superheroic life, then make them all interact. And when they’re at the mercy 
of dangerous foes, or the situation warrants...unmask them.


### THE LEGACY
* Remind them of their traditions
* Compare them to the past
* Make them answer their family’s concerns
* Raise expectations on them
* Honor them

The Legacy is caught up in a tradition of heroism, and having one at 
your table makes family important. Every PC will be compared to the older 
generation to some extent, but the Legacy has direct predecessors, alongside 
rules and traditions they’ve sworn to uphold. Make those prior heroes matter 
more by talking about them often and having them show up at the worst 
possible times.

Keep  pushing  on  them  what  their  legacy  means,  but  don’t  hesitate  to 
diversify that meaning—what it means to prior members of the legacy may 
not be the same as what it means to the public, and they’ll all expect different 
traditions to be upheld. Constantly compare the Legacy to their predecessors, 
and use the comparisons to shift the Legacy’s Labels. Give them further duties, 
obligations, and missions directly from their own legacy; if their legacy has 
famous enemies, then catching or defeating those foes is a great additional 
burden to saddle them with. 

Sometimes, sit them down for a talk with members of their legacy to 
discuss their recent performance—and don’t let them off the hook. Remember 
that you’re ultimately responsible for making the move for the legacy trigger, 
to see how members of the legacy respond to the PC’s recent actions; don’t let 
that slide for too long.


### THE NOVA
* Remind them of past collateral damage
* Reveal a terrible truth of their powers
* Make their powers flare out of control
* Stoke their conditions
* Introduce threats only they can tackle

The Nova is pure power, and they’re likely to think they can handle nearly 
any threat—what’s more, they’re probably right. But they can’t do it without 
paying a high price, and that price drives the playbook. Having a Nova at your 
table should amp up the power level of the threats and dangers the heroes 
deal with—the Nova plays for high stakes, and they’ve made the mistakes to 
prove it. 

Never let the Nova forget the past damage they’ve caused. Have people 
hold grudges or explain why they’re worried about the Nova’s self control. 
Sometimes, cause the Nova’s powers to flare out of control, to lash out and 
cause further damage.

The Nova’s heavily tied up in their own head—play with that. Show them 
that their powers are truly dangerous, or come from an insidious source, or 
have an inherent cost, and let them deal with that terrible truth. Play to their 
conditions, their anger or their fear or their insecurity, and harp on them, while 
giving them opportunities to take action to clear those conditions.


### THE OUTSIDER
* Draw attention to their differences
* Make a request from home
* Introduce a monitor from home
* Accept and support them in their moments of weakness
* Provoke their beliefs and practices in tense situations

The Outsider is a stranger who’s interested in fitting in. Don’t ever let them 
forget the struggle. Call out how they look, act, and think differently, especially 
using NPCs with Influence over the Outsider to shift their Labels. Give them 
a reason to stay—show them the best parts of Earth, and accept them when 
they’re low. 

But provoke and prod at their beliefs, make them decide if they really want 
to commit to this strange place. And never let them totally forget their home. 
Even if they don’t think they have direct contact to their home, send them 
missives from where they come from, making myriad requests, everything 
from “Collect this” to “Come home!” Introduce characters from their home 
who come to Earth for at least some time, who watch the PC and judge them. 

Having an Outsider at your table means you should introduce other aliens 
and cultures. Play up other outsider groups. Make Halcyon City, and the 
universe, full of strange, wonderful, and terrible people.


### THE PROTÉGÉ
* Convey their mistakes
* Bestow wisdom, wanted or unwanted
* Hold up a mirror to them
* Give them exactly what they need at a cost
* Endanger their mentor

The Protégé is about their relationship with their mentor—so you have to 
make that mentor show up a lot. The Protégé also makes past generations of 
heroism matter far more than many playbooks, so be prepared to introduce 
those older heroes if you’ve got a Protégé in play. But focus on the mentor—
chances are good that the mentor will have opinions of everyone on the team, 
not just the Protégé.

The mentor is here to teach the Protégé, so they should always be telling 
the Protégé what the PC has done wrong, and providing new advice and 
knowledge. They don’t have to be mean about it, but inherently just pointing 
out the Protégé’s mistakes should drive them up the wall a bit. The mentor 
can provide the team with great resources and information, too—but always 
at a price, most often that the team follow the mentor’s rules or suffer through 
another lesson. 

Make the mentor awesome, too—make them someone the Protégé might 
genuinely  want  to  be. And  then  show  them  the  costs  of  the  life  that  the 
mentor leads, so the Protégé can see what they’re becoming. Show a mirror 
to the Protégé, and ask them if they really want to be this person, or someone 
different.

And sometimes, put their mentor in danger, with the only salvation coming 
from the Protégé themselves. Give the Protégé the chance to show their mentor 
everything they’ve learned.


### THE TRANSFORMED
* Reject them
* Show how they are feared or hated
* Attack them with unthinking hordes
* Remind them of what they’ve lost
* See their true self

The Transformed looks different, can’t hide it, and feels insecure about it. 
They bring into play issues of being different and wanting to fit in, but from a 
different perspective to the Outsider. The Outsider might be able to teach Earth 
something—there might be a compromise. The Transformed, though, used to 
be normal…and never will be again. The Transformed won’t find compromise 
with those around them. The best they can hope for is acceptance. 

Reject  the  Transformed  and  show  the  negative  reactions  their  form 
provokes. People fear and hate them for how they look, and their struggle is 
about overcoming those perspectives; so provide plenty of rejection. Attack 
them with unthinking hordes, especially from a “villagers with pitchforks” 
perspective. Show them the things they’ve lost and can’t do anymore. 

Sometimes, though, give them a reprieve. Don’t do it too often, but have 
NPCs see through their visage to the real person beneath. Sympathize with 
their pain and support them. It will make the next rejection all the more 
painful.
