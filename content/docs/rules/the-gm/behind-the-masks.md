# 面具之下
你的玩家所選擇的扮演書能告訴你的不僅僅只有超級英雄的超能力和動作──它們還會告訴你你的玩家在遊戲過程中期待看見的問題和主題。這可能會在遊戲過程中產生改變；也許命帶天劫者會意外地對他們的浪漫感情戲勾起了注意、或也許外來者其實對他們的雙重身分感興趣。但無論如何，這些扮演書揭示了玩家們希望在遊戲中看到什麼樣的衝突。

As much as possible, keep in mind what moves and options they select—
those options give you further clues about what they want to see during play. 
But don’t worry about this too much. Ultimately, the players are in charge of 
their own characters and making their moves come into play. 

Pay close attention to the contents of this section: the playbook moves. 
Each playbook comes with a few GM moves, catered to that playbook’s specific 
issues and elements. Use these moves when you could make any other move to 
drive attention to those thematic pieces of each character. 


### 明燈 THE BEACON
* 關注他們的不足之處
* 讚揚他們的優點
* 讓他們為自己的大膽付出代價
* 將他們與其他人做比較
* 發揮他們的驅動力

明燈的主題在於做一個其他瘋狂、頂尖超級英雄身旁的「陪襯配角」。他們是正常人，徹頭徹尾的普通人，對於這樣的角色一直存在著一個強烈的爭辯：他們不應該待在這個團隊──而身為GM，這正是你的職責，去帶出這個爭辯。質疑他們，讓他們感到不安，然後給他們閃耀的機會，展現出他們最為擅長的技藝。留意明燈的〈驅動力〉──它們會告訴你明燈希望去做什麼，而你也應該盡你所能的去協助明燈完成它們，至少一場聚會一個。


### 蠻牛 THE BULL
* 使他們的摯愛陷入危險
* 提高他們的勁敵
* 揭露關於他們過去的黑暗秘密
* 讓跟他們相像的某人發動攻擊
* 以俗世力量包圍他們

The Bull is hyperfocused on their love and rival, by default. Go with that. 
Play  up  those  relationships.  Make  their  love  endangered,  and  their  rival 
bolstered, to give them chances to react. Sometimes, flip it to keep things 
interesting—endanger  their  rival  and  bolster  their  love  (maybe  with  a 
competing love interest). 

The Bull comes from some dark past, some weapons program, something 
that made them so destructive. Bring that up, and don’t ever let them totally 
forget what they are, especially by using villains and other enemies just like 
them, or by swarming them with mundane forces to watch them prove what a 
weapon they are when they overcome.


### 不良少年 THE DELINQUENT
* 將他們銬起來
* 給予或奪走觀眾
* 給他們有條件的愛
* 向他們展示界線
* 對他們伸出援手

不良少年很可能會是個毫無理由的叛逆者，也可能會是一個正在尋求觀眾的表演者。他們憤世嫉俗、尖酸刻薄、但又渴望誠實、天真積極的關係。發揮他們性格的每一面。用規則限制他們好讓他們能夠打破束縛，但同時也提供他們支持和援助，利用人際關係來綑綁他們。

有時候，把他們放到一群喜歡他們嘩眾取寵行為的觀眾面前；其他時候，把觀眾帶走，讓他們感到孤獨和冷漠。給他們愛，但給這份愛附加條件。永遠不要讓他們忘記，在他們之上還有其他力量制定了規則和界線。


### 命帶天劫者 THE DOOMED
* 標記他們的末日軌
* 給他們機會進一步發展他們的目標
* 提醒他們關於他們可能會失去的事物
* 把他們推往懸崖邊緣
* 提供有代價的暫時慰藉

The  Doomed  is  fatalistic  and  grim. Adding  a  Doomed  to  your  game 
inherently puts death on the table, and makes your entire game a bit darker. 
Don’t ever let them forget that they’re doomed. Have other characters reference 
it, add bits of description about it to the fiction, and make them mark their 
doom track. 

Show them the best of the people around them, people who care about 
them—make them want to stay here in this world. All the while, edge the 
Doomed closer and closer to the brink, hitting them hard, so they have to 
resort to their doomsigns and other resources for victory. Try to remember 
their conditions for advancing their doom track, so you can make moves 
toward those.

For the doomsign Infinite Powers , make sure they know they can take 
an ability from another playbook for a one-time action—not a move from 
another playbook. 

Talk to them to make sure you have a joint understanding of what the 
triggers that advance their doom track look like. And don’t worry about giving 
them a final confrontation with their doom. If it makes sense in the fiction, 
give them the opportunity to overcome it, but they’ll have to contend with their 
doom, one way or another, thanks to their advances.


### 雙面人 THE JANUS
* 讓他們承擔他們的義務
* 使他們其中一個身分中的某人遭遇危險
* 讓他們的兩個人生交錯
* 把更多的義務加諸在他們身上
* 摘下他們的面具

The Janus is about the double life, the nature of having two identities. Push 
them on it. You’re in charge of saying when time passes, so you’re in charge 
of saying when the Janus has to roll for their social obligations—don’t skimp 
on it. Continually ask them which life they’re in. If someone doesn’t know the 
identity they’re currently in, ask the Janus if the Influence they hold over that 
person would really apply. 

Make both lives tough. Their superheroic life is obviously difficult, because 
the team as a whole will be mixed up in crazy drama. But they need specific 
pushing from their mundane life and the obligations therein. Have those in 
their mundane life lay obligations upon them. Put the people in their mundane 
life in danger as much as those in their superheroic life. 

Give the people in their mundane life opinions on the people in their 
superheroic life, then make them all interact. And when they’re at the mercy 
of dangerous foes, or the situation warrants...unmask them.


### 傳承者 THE LEGACY
* 提醒他們關於他們的家族傳承
* 把他們跟過往做比較
* 讓他們回應他們家族的關心
* 提高對他們的期望
* 給他們榮譽

傳承者深陷於一個英雄主義的家族傳承之中，而讓傳承者出現在你的遊戲桌將使家庭變得相當重要。在某種程度上，每個PC都會被跟過往的世代做比較，但傳承者有著關係更為直接的前輩，伴隨著他們誓言需要維護的規則和傳統。透過經常性的談論前任英雄、讓他們在最糟糕的時機登場，讓這些人物變得更為重要。

持續推動他們去思考關於他們傳承的意義，但不要猶豫於讓這個意義多樣化──它對於家族傳承成員的意義以及它對社會大眾的意義可能不會相同，他們可能會期望你維護不同的傳統。經常性地把傳承者和他們的前任做比較，並利用比較來調動傳承者的標籤屬性。從他們的家族傳承直接給予他們更進一步的責任、義務、和任務；如果他們的家族傳承擁有著名的死敵，那麼逮捕或擊敗這些敵人也會在他們背上加諸很大的負擔。

有時候，讓他們坐下來，與他們家族傳承的成員談論關於他們最近的表現──不要放過他們。記住，觸發傳承者的〈家族傳承〉動作就是你的最終責任；看看家族成員們會如何回應PC最近的行動；不要讓這件事拖延太久。


### 超新星 THE NOVA
* 提醒他們過去造成的附帶傷害
* 揭露關於他們超能力的可怕真相
* 讓他們的力量失控
* 煽動他們的狀態
* 導入只有他們能夠處理的威脅

The Nova is pure power, and they’re likely to think they can handle nearly 
any threat—what’s more, they’re probably right. But they can’t do it without 
paying a high price, and that price drives the playbook. Having a Nova at your 
table should amp up the power level of the threats and dangers the heroes 
deal with—the Nova plays for high stakes, and they’ve made the mistakes to 
prove it. 

Never let the Nova forget the past damage they’ve caused. Have people 
hold grudges or explain why they’re worried about the Nova’s self control. 
Sometimes, cause the Nova’s powers to flare out of control, to lash out and 
cause further damage.

The Nova’s heavily tied up in their own head—play with that. Show them 
that their powers are truly dangerous, or come from an insidious source, or 
have an inherent cost, and let them deal with that terrible truth. Play to their 
conditions, their anger or their fear or their insecurity, and harp on them, while 
giving them opportunities to take action to clear those conditions.


### 外來者 THE OUTSIDER
* 關注他們與周遭的不同之處
* 指派來自家鄉的要求
* 導入一個來自家鄉的監控者
* 在他們軟弱的時候接受並支持他們
* 在緊張情境下激起他們的信念和行動

The Outsider is a stranger who’s interested in fitting in. Don’t ever let them 
forget the struggle. Call out how they look, act, and think differently, especially 
using NPCs with Influence over the Outsider to shift their Labels. Give them 
a reason to stay—show them the best parts of Earth, and accept them when 
they’re low. 

But provoke and prod at their beliefs, make them decide if they really want 
to commit to this strange place. And never let them totally forget their home. 
Even if they don’t think they have direct contact to their home, send them 
missives from where they come from, making myriad requests, everything 
from “Collect this” to “Come home!” Introduce characters from their home 
who come to Earth for at least some time, who watch the PC and judge them. 

Having an Outsider at your table means you should introduce other aliens 
and cultures. Play up other outsider groups. Make Halcyon City, and the 
universe, full of strange, wonderful, and terrible people.


### 門徒 THE PROTÉGÉ
* 傳達出他們的錯誤
* 給予智慧，無論他們是否想要
* 舉起一面對著他們的鏡子
* 給他們正好需要的，但伴隨著代價
* 使他們的導師陷入危險

門徒的主題在於他們跟導師之間的關係──所以你必須讓導師經常登場。跟其他扮演書相比，門徒也讓過往的英雄世代變得更為重要，所以如果門徒出現在遊戲中，那麼最好準備把這些年長的英雄導入故事中。但特別專注在導師身上──導師很有可能會對團隊中的每個人都提出意見，而不僅僅是門徒。

導師是來教導門徒的，所以他永遠應該要告訴門徒他們做錯了什麼，並提供他們新的建議和智慧。他不需要表現刻薄，但從本質上來說，僅僅指出門徒犯下的錯誤就足以把他們逼到惱火。導師也能為團隊提供許多的資源和情報──但永遠伴隨著代價，這通常會是團隊必須遵循導師的規則、或再承受一次訓練。

也要記得讓導師令人驚嘆──讓他成為門徒真心想要成為的人物。然後展現出導師所過生活的代價，好讓門徒能看見自己正在變成什麼樣的人物。給門徒展現一面鏡子，然後詢問他們是否真的想要成為這樣的人物、或另一個截然不同的樣貌。

有時候，也讓他們的導師陷入危險，並讓唯一的救贖來自於門徒自己。給門徒一個機會向導師展現他們所學到的一切。


### 異變者 THE TRANSFORMED
* 拒絕他們
* 展現他們是如何被恐懼或憎恨的
* 讓不加思索的群眾攻擊他們
* 提醒他們關於他們失去的事物
* 看見他們真實的自我

The Transformed looks different, can’t hide it, and feels insecure about it. 
They bring into play issues of being different and wanting to fit in, but from a 
different perspective to the Outsider. The Outsider might be able to teach Earth 
something—there might be a compromise. The Transformed, though, used to 
be normal…and never will be again. The Transformed won’t find compromise 
with those around them. The best they can hope for is acceptance. 

Reject  the  Transformed  and  show  the  negative  reactions  their  form 
provokes. People fear and hate them for how they look, and their struggle is 
about overcoming those perspectives; so provide plenty of rejection. Attack 
them with unthinking hordes, especially from a “villagers with pitchforks” 
perspective. Show them the things they’ve lost and can’t do anymore. 

Sometimes, though, give them a reprieve. Don’t do it too often, but have 
NPCs see through their visage to the real person beneath. Sympathize with 
their pain and support them. It will make the next rejection all the more 
painful.
