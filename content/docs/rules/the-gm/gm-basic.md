# 目標事項
目標事項是你在主持遊戲時最首要的大目標。你必須在它們之間平衡分配你的重點和注意力。
* 讓神翠市如同漫畫一般
* 讓玩家角色的生活像是超級英雄
* 用玩的來看看會發生什麼事

<h3>讓神翠市如同漫畫一般</h3>
神翠市是一個瘋狂、驚奇、充滿不可思議的地方，這裡充斥著怪物、變種人、外星人、巫師、或其他更多稀奇古怪的玩意兒。擁抱它！享受它！然後愛上它！《蒙面少俠》和神翠市的基礎始於那些超級英雄漫畫所講述的故事；而善加運用這些故事的橋段和技巧只會讓《蒙面少俠》更有趣。你的工作就是讓你們的《蒙面少俠》感覺像是你們最喜歡的全新漫畫，而這個章節其餘的內容也將會提供你所需的工具來達成這一個目標。

<h3>讓玩家角色的生活像是超級英雄</h3>
儘管許多玩家角色其實都渴望過著穩定且正常的生活，但身為GM，你的職責就是讓他們的生活適度地變得不可思議且如同超級英雄一般。《蒙面少俠》要講述的故事並不是角色們在大賣場逛街買衣服──而是角色們前往賣場，然後超級反派正好選在這個時機點發動攻擊。

讓他們的生活充滿趣味以及史詩感！

<h3>用玩的來看看會發生什麼事</h3>
你不知道遊戲過程中究竟會發生什麼事。你不知道玩家角色們會變成什麼樣子。你也不知道他們將會如何改變這座城市。這正是為什麼你會想要遊玩這個遊戲的原因──因為你期待著找到答案！《蒙面少俠》是一個關於改變的遊戲，關於青少年們如何成長，關於這座城市如何反應、如何因應裏頭的人們重新形塑自己的樣貌。不要去規劃任何一個事件發生的過程──你只需要計畫如何去推動和刺激角色和環境，然後看看到底事情會變成什麼樣子。

# 永遠說…
有時候，你會被不同的目標事項所困，你會不知道究竟該如何推進故事。如果你陷入了這種困境，那麼永遠說：
* 原則所要求的
* 規則所要求的
* 誠實所要求的
* 你事前準備所要求的

**原則**是你為了抵達目標事項而踏上的途徑；**規則**是整個遊戲的骨架，你將圍繞它來構築其他一切。依靠它們，不要打破它們。如果某個角色應該要〈承受沉重打擊〉，讓他擲骰。如果某個玩家骰出了失敗，那麼即使他的角色才剛在一個令人心碎的場景中對他的愛人吐露心聲，你仍必須進行一個動作。不要捏造骰子的結果。遵循規則，並讓它們引導你完成一個精彩的故事。

規則同時也讓每個人都處在同一個平等的基礎上──它們是公開且誠實的。而你的工作正是在你所做的一切事情上維持這個誠實性。你不該向PC或玩家們隱瞞關鍵情報。畢竟，他們唯一能認識他們身處場景以及周遭世界的方式，就是透過你的描述。如果有某些東西顯而易見，不要指望他們自行發覺──告訴他們！如果玩家詢問你關於某個他們角色應該要知道的情報，不要含糊其詞或隱瞞──直接回答他們，或把問題拋回去讓他們回答！

這種直接性相當重要，尤其是當它關乎只有你知道的情報──也就是你的事前準備。如果你在遊戲前事先準備了一些東西，比如說故事弧、或是某個反派，那麼不要無緣無故偏離你的準備。堅持你的敘事事實！當你為一個反派設定了一個動作：「抵銷他周遭的所有超能力」，那麼你就應該照著做。你的事前準備能幫助你對這個世界保持誠實，並讓你的神翠市維持設定上的一致性。


---
# 原則
如果說目標事項是你要達成的目標，那原則就是你達成目標的方法。它們是規則的一部分──不要違背它們！──但必須由你來搞清楚它們該如何在任何特定情境下被應用。它們是你創作出最好的《蒙面少俠》故事的途徑。使用它們，遊戲就會成功！但忽略它們，那麼就會在你臉上炸開。
* 如同漫畫一般地描述
* 對英雄們說話，而非玩家
* 使用你的動作，但不要直接說出它們的名字
* 讓威脅真實
* 放棄並擇日再戰
* 把人命視為有意義的
* 讓超能力看起來驚人奇異、創意非凡、且酷炫十足
* 給反派們動機以表現他們的人性
* 讓成人們看起來幼稚且短視
* 援助他們，但是帶有條件
* 提出誘導性的問題，並基於答案構築
* 做玩家角色們的粉絲
* 把你的ＮＰＣ當成槌子：方榫，圓孔
* 提醒他們關於在這之前過往世代的種種
* 記得考慮畫框外的事物
* 有時候，放棄做決定

<h3>如同漫畫一般地描述</h3>
不要只是設置場景然後描述那裡有什麼──而是描述漫畫第一格描繪著什麼樣的畫面。告訴我們分鏡是如何變化，人們說了或做了些什麼。在整個遊戲中週期性的用這種手法切入，不僅僅是描繪故事中發生的行動，也描述它們做為一本漫畫的內容是如何被呈現的。也許其中一格畫出了狠狠揍下的鐵拳，下一格展現了你的敵人被擊飛到了空中，然後再下一格則描繪了他撞上了牆壁──試著描述每一格的內容。

《蒙面少俠》基於許多不同的載體題材，但超級英雄漫畫是它最重要的核心。運用它們的藝術風格來幫助你更生動、有趣、和詳盡地描述你們的故事。想一想什麼樣的畫面在漫畫上會好看，以及你想要在你的漫畫故事中看到什麼。刺激的視覺效果！酷炫的角度！有趣的分鏡！不要只是呈現靜態的畫面，也不要只是普通的直敘。


<h3>對英雄們說話，而非玩家</h3>
The story’s about the heroes, right? They’re the ones dealing with teachers 
who’d love to hold them in detention, even though they absolutely have to go 
deal with that black hole in the sky, right? So don’t talk to the players—talk to 
the people really dealing with those problems. Instead of “Hey, Joe, what does 
Hornet do?”, say “Hornet, what do you do?” It keeps everybody focused on the 
fiction, on these characters, on their triumphs and travails.

You’re acting as those characters’ lens into the world. Tell them what they 
see, what they hear, what they know, fully and truly. “Source Code is way closer 
to the computer terminal than you are; it’s obvious she’ll get there before you 
do, unless you do something. What do you do, Hornet?” Don’t ever let them 
flounder for lack of information.

<h3>使用你的動作，但不要直接說出它們的名字</h3>
When you make a move—a specific thing you say happens—don’t say its name. 
Say what happens, say how it feels, say what the characters see or hear or 
experience—but don’t say exactly what move you just made. Say, “Oh man, 
you chuck that car at Rampage, but she just knocks it away. The car hits the fire 
truck dealing with the conflagration in the back and knocks it over. Without 
any more water on it, it’s like the fire comes alive—and you know there are still 
people inside!” Don’t say, “I just put innocents in danger!”

Sometimes you still need to bring up the mechanical effect of a move 
you made, like pointing out that you just took or gave Influence or inflicted 
a condition—but couch those changes in the fiction. Say, “Nano taunts you, 
running through an almost itemized list of all your failures, and you can feel 
your blood boil—mark Angry.” Don’t say, “Nano inflicts a condition on you.”

<h3>讓威脅真實</h3>
Superhero stories are often about stopping terrible things from happening. But 
that all becomes rote if the threats aren’t truly threatening. Make the scope and 
focus of threats real and meaningful—and the best way to do that is often to 
make them small and personal. If a villain threatens to turn your best friend 
into their apprentice? That’s a real threat.

The second part of making threats real is to sometimes deliver on them, 
hard. If the PCs take action to stop a threat, and the rolls go their way, then 
fine—you’re playing to find out, and they overcame the threat. But if they get 
a miss, or if they give you a golden opportunity through their actions—then 
deliver on the threat. Follow through. Make it real.


<h3>放棄並擇日再戰</h3>
In MASKS, a lot of the characters and elements you portray are straight-up 
opposition to the PCs. They’re villains with dastardly plans; they’re monsters 
on a rampage. You may feel a compulsion to have those forces drive, endlessly, 
toward their goals until they’re either victorious or destroyed. 

Resist that urge. Those villains don’t always drive towards their goals to 
the point of near-suicidal determination—they give up. They run away. If 
it’s obvious they’re going to lose, they flee and look for new opportunities. 
Not every fight has to go to the bitter end—any fight that ends earlier leaves 
elements open to resolve down the line.

This goes for social scenes, too. A domineering hero who’s trying to get a 
PC to see the world their way shouldn’t necessarily press the issue to extremes 
every single time—they give up to fight another day. To bring up the problem 
down the line.

<h3>把人命視為有意義的</h3>
People matter. Their lives have value. That means your stories shouldn’t involve 
wanton mass murder or death. Never kill a bunch of people just to show the 
situation is dangerous. It should be momentous when an anti-hero finds it 
expedient to take human lives—it shouldn’t be the norm. It also means every 
time a building or a piece of the city is threatened, you should immediately flag 
the people endangered, so a hero can save them.

Regular, mundane lives are important, too. You don’t have to be a demi-god 
to get consideration in the story. Parents, teachers, siblings, police, librarians, 
lawyers—they’re all people, not just caricatures. You should portray them as 
people, with their own lives and goals and drives and desires. They can lend 
a hand to the PCs, and they can stand in the PCs’ way. And that way, when a 
situation puts them in danger, it’s a person who is endangered.  

<h3>讓超能力看起來驚人奇異、創意非凡、且酷炫十足</h3>
Superhuman pieces of the world should be just that—superhuman. Beyond the 
mundane, beyond normal. Strange, exciting, bizarre, magical. The superhuman 
side of Halcyon City is meant to be extraordinary. Who cares about what feels 
realistic in terms of superpowers or plots? Go nuts! A lady who can send 
her mind into pieces of the city and possess them, bringing them to life—
absolutely! A guy made of pure imagination, capable of reshaping his body to 
his whim, but barely existing and ethereal—sure! An alien robot, powered by 
a miniature sun, and looking for love—yes!

Make your superhumans truly super. There’s nothing more boring than 
“just another guy who’s invulnerable and super strong” in a superhero story.

<h3>給反派們動機以表現他們的人性</h3>
All villains are in some way people. If they aren’t people, they aren’t really 
villains—a robo T-Rex is an awesome threat to fight once, but not as a recurring 
villain, unless it’s intelligent, with desires, insecurities, fears, and more. Villains 
may be extreme, over the top, terrible, awful, and criminal, but they’re still 
human—even the ones that are robots or aliens or whatever. 

Give every single villain, then, a drive that features their core humanity. 
Drives are statements of intent: “To _____.” “To save the life of my sister by any 
means necessary.” “To discredit the fake and unworthy heroes.” “To make the 
people who once tortured me pay.” No villain should ever want to take over the 
world just ’cause. They want to take over the world for a reason.

<h3>讓成人們看起來幼稚且短視</h3>
It’s easy to play adults as superior, wiser, and better than the younger PCs. But 
that gets frustrating really quickly for the PCs, if the adults are consistently 
smarter than their younger counterparts. Instead, draw out the adults’ own 
childish and short-sighted behavior—make clear that even though they’re 
older, that doesn’t mean they have all their ducks in a row. They think they’re 
right—and often, they petulantly stick to their guns even when proved wrong. 

The core of this principle is making adults flawed in the same ways that the 
PCs themselves are flawed. The adults may have a better idea of who they are 
than the PCs do, but that doesn’t mean they necessarily make smart decisions. 
Even the PCs’ own mentors, or the greatest heroes in the city, are fallible. The 
only way the PCs can mature is if they see that the adults are just as flawed as 
they are. 

<h3>援助他們，但是帶有條件</h3>
Some of the adults in MASKS may be kind, fostering, and supportive—but they 
probably always think they know who the PCs should turn out to be, and 
they’ll act to make their opinions clear. They might support the PCs, providing 
encouragement and positive words, but always in an attempt to get the PCs to 
trend in the direction they want—always conditionally. And if the PCs refuse 
to fulfill those conditions, the NPCs will make their discontent known, in 
anything from angry speeches to barely veiled disapproving looks. 

By default, the kind of support many of the PCs will inevitably seek should 
be conditional, depending on the behavior of the PCs. Over time, it might 
be possible to earn someone’s open approval unconditionally—but that’s a 
long way away. Make the PCs either choose to go it on their own, or play by 
someone else’s rules to receive approval.

<h3>提出誘導性的問題，並基於答案構築</h3>
Always ask questions of the PCs. When you’re curious about something and one 
of them should know the answer, ask. Make the question pointed, provocative, 
and leading. Not, “Is there anyone in your class you like?” But, “Someone here 
is your best friend. Who is it?” Not, “Have you ever been defeated by a villain?” 
But, “How did Vortex defeat you so badly last time you clashed?” 

Only ask provocative questions that the PCs would know the answers 
to. You shouldn’t ask them, “What’s that villain’s dastardly plan?” unless it’s 
somehow believable that they would know. 

Remember those answers, keep in mind they add to the fiction, and target 
them for further development. Those answers are now true, and what’s more, 
the PC who gave you that answer is inherently interested in it—it was their 
answer! Don’t let it lie. Build on it.

<h3>做玩家角色們的粉絲</h3>
The main characters of a game of MASKS are always the PCs. No NPC is ever as 
important as the PCs. And you, as an audience member of this story, are always 
more interested in the PCs’ stories than anybody else’s stories. 

When you’re saying what happens next, think about it from the perspective 
of a fan. What would you want to see next? Would you really want to see 
the Protégé, an incredibly adept fighter, look 
like a clumsy fool? Would you really like 
to see the Transformed just be accepted 
instantly  and  loved,  without  any 
trials or tribulations?

Being  a  fan  means  both 
that  you  want  the  PCs  to  be 
awesome,  and  that  you  want 
to see them pressed. They go 
together! Putting pressure on 
the PCs means they have the 
chance to be awesome. But it 
means you won’t want to see 
them  made  chumps,  or  look 
incompetent,  or  anything 
similar.  Ruining  the  core 
conceits  of  a  character,  or 
taking away what makes them 
cool—that’s the epitome of not 
being a fan.

<h3>把你的ＮＰＣ當成槌子：方榫，圓孔</h3>
NPCs all have ideas for who the PCs should be. They don’t just withhold 
approval until the PCs act the way they want—they take active steps to change 
and reshape the PCs. It doesn’t matter if the PCs want to go into those shapes. 
They’re going to hammer away at the PCs anyway.

Villains are great for this. They often want the PCs to either think less of 
themselves or adopt ideologies that match the villain’s own. The PCs won’t 
necessarily seek approval from those villains...but that doesn’t mean the villains 
won’t try to impose their own views on the PCs, to hammer them into shape.

Mechanically, this looks like telling the PCs who they are or how the world 
works, and thereby shifting their Labels, among other things. But so long as the 
NPCs are trying to reshape the PCs, for good or for ill, they’re doing their job.

<h3>提醒他們關於在這之前過往世代的種種</h3>
Halcyon City has had several generations of heroes. The city is built on the 
shoulders of those who came before—their triumphs, their mistakes, their 
successes, their failures. Many of those characters are still around in Halcyon 
City to this day. Current problems have their origins in the past, too, in the 
prior generations and their flaws. 

Never let the PCs forget that there were several other generations before 
them, that those characters shaped the world the PCs live in today, and that in 
many ways, those older generations are still in power. The PCs aren’t pioneers—
they’re denizens of realms already explored and colonized.

<h3>記得考慮畫框外的事物</h3>
In  comics  terminology,  a “gutter”  is  that  space  between  any  two  panels. 
Thinking in the gutters between panels means thinking about what happens 
between the things you talk about during the game’s conversation. Halcyon 
City lives and breathes; the villains make plans, the heroes keep thwarting the 
villains, and life continues. The key to making your Halcyon City feel alive is 
to make sure things keep happening, whether or not you see them firsthand 
in your game. 

Don’t just make moves and say what happens based only on what’s narrated 
directly in the course of play. Make moves and say what happens based on what 
would’ve happened between the panels. If it makes sense that the Protégé’s 
mentor would’ve made their own attempt to take down the Magus, then make 
your moves and say what happens. If it makes sense that the Dread Queen 
would’ve worked on a way to neutralize the Legacy’s dangerous powers, then 
make moves and say what happens then too.

<h3>有時候，放棄做決定</h3>
Sometimes, you need to make a decision about what to say or what happens 
next, and you don’t want to make the decision yourself. Would the August agree 
to Hornet’s plan to take down Satin? Would Cuckoo possess Grasshopper’s sister 
before Grasshopper gets home? In those cases, it can help to disclaim decision-
making, and pass the choice off to some other source of authority. Your choices 
are: the moves, the players, the characters, and the arcs. 

To disclaim authority to the moves, interpret the action either in terms of 
the basic moves or your GM moves. If you can find a move that fits, it should 
help resolve the uncertainty for you—just do what that move says. “Would the 
August agree to Hornet’s plan to take down Satin?” “Yes, so long as Hornet agrees 
to stop training with Mantis and come train with him instead. He’s supporting 
Hornet conditionally.” 

To disclaim authority to the players, make it a question about what they do, 
specifically. Push them until they do something that resolves the uncertainty 
for  you.  “Would  the  August  agree  to  Hornet’s  plan  to  take  down  Satin?” 
“Somebody should provoke him or pierce his mask to find out!”

To disclaim authority to the NPCs, look at the drives and moves of the 
NPCs involved, and follow them through to their conclusion. If the drives and 
moves support one course over all the others, go with that. “Would the August 
agree to Hornet’s plan to take down Satin?” “The August has the drive ‘To serve 
and protect the whole of Halcyon City at any cost.’ So, yes—he’d go with the plan 
to save Halcyon from Satin.”

To disclaim authority to the arcs, look at your arcs and hooks (page 181), 
and see if you can use them to answer the question for you. “Would the August 
agree to Hornet’s plan to take down Satin?” “The August is a hook for Hornet, 
pulling her to be a Savior. He’ll agree if Hornet puts the emphasis of the plan on 
saving people, and not on beating Satin.”

# GM動作
Your agendas are your goals, and your principles are the paths you take to achieve 
your goals. Your moves, then, are the things you actually say during the game to 
fill in what happens next. They’re individual steps you take towards your goal.

Often, it’s enough to let the players tell you what they do and focus on any 
moves they trigger along the way. If they roll a hit, the moves usually tell you 
what happens next. But sometimes that’s not enough: when they roll a miss, 
and you have to make a hard move; when no one’s triggering any moves, and 
they’re all looking at you expectantly; or when you just think that you should 
make a move as a follow-up to something that happens. 


## SOFTER MOVES VS. HARDER MOVES
Throughout the book, I’ve made reference to hard moves, which implies that 
there are soft moves. Whether a move is harder or softer is about how much, 
and how directly, it changes the fiction. Softer moves set the stage for harder 
moves in the future, and can be dealt with, stopped, and undermined before 
they lead to a harder move. Harder moves change the fiction immediately and 
importantly, and can’t be stopped. 

As GM, you decide how hard or soft to make any given move. Keep in mind 
your agendas and principles, though. If you’re hitting with hard moves all the 
time, chances are you’re not being a fan of the PCs. If you’re using soft moves 
all the time, then you’re not making your threats real.


##### SOFTER MOVE EXAMPLES
{{< hint info >}}
You show up back at your base, but something’s off. The door isn’t locked, and the lights 
inside are flickering. You look around, but you don’t see anyone. What do you do? 
{{< /hint >}}
{{< hint info >}}
When you arrive at home, your mom is sitting in her armchair, waiting for you. The 
TV’s on, showing your recent exploits. She’s not watching though—her eyes are locked 
on you. She says, “Well? Any words to explain your behavior?” 
{{< /hint >}}

##### HARDER MOVE EXAMPLES
{{< hint info >}}
You show up back at your base, but something’s off. The door isn’t locked, and the 
lights inside are flickering. Suddenly, in a blur of motion, Shell comes hurtling out of 
the base punches you in the chest. Take a powerful blow, and then…what do you do? 
{{< /hint >}}
{{< hint info >}}
When you arrive at home, your mom is sitting in her armchair, waiting for you. The 
TV’s on, showing your recent exploits. She’s not watching though—her eyes are locked 
on you. She says, “I’m ashamed of your behavior tonight. You didn’t act like a hero—
you acted like a thug.” She’s shifting your Savior down and your Danger up. What do 
you do?
{{< /hint >}}


## MAKE A MOVE WHEN…
You make a move—as hard or as soft as you like—when: 
* ...there’s a lull in the conversation. 
* ...a player misses a roll. 
* ...a player hands you a golden opportunity. 

**You’re the Editor in Chief, in charge of keeping the story interesting.**
When everybody’s looking around, unsure of what happens next...when the 
conversation stalls...that’s your cue. Step in. Make something happen. You can 
usually get away with softer moves in this case. 

**You’re the Voice of Fate, in charge of interpreting misses.** When someone 
rolls a miss on a move, you’re the ultimate authority on what happens next. 
Whatever move you make needs to flow from the fiction, based on what’s come 
before and the circumstances of the missed roll. If the PC’s move describes a 
miss condition, follow those guidelines. Otherwise, you make whatever move 
fits, hard or soft as you choose. 

**You’re the Keeper of Continuity, in charge of following the fiction and seizing opportunities.** When someone does something that’s just begging for 
a move, then make one! A PC can’t go charging at Dominus, the time-traveling 
god-being, and not expect to get smacked. You’re in charge of making sure that 
when the fiction demands a move, you make one.
