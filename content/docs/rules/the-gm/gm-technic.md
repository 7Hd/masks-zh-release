# 連鎖反應
《蒙面少俠》中的動作被設計成能輕易串聯在一塊：一個動作的結束會立刻導致下一個動作的產生。部份成功（7-9的結果）更是會把情況推向尚未被解決的緊張局勢──你並沒有直接打倒觸手末日怪，而僅僅是傷害了牠，接著牠也擊中了你，然後你將這頭怪物打到了另一個位置，讓你有機會將牠狠狠從城市踢飛出去，如此這般。即使擲骰失敗也經常會導致需要反應的情境，而這些反應也將接著帶出新的動作。這就是你在遊戲中營造出緊張、有效、有趣場景的方式──這同時也是你如何描繪出精彩萬分的戰鬥場景的手段。每一拳都會造成場景中的另一個變化，從而導致下一次攻擊的發生。

做為GM，你可以控制這些動作滾雪球的程度。你所描繪的某些情境能夠衍生的連鎖反應會比其他更多一些——打個比方，如果你囚禁了其中一名PC，那麼連鎖反應就會結束在這；但反過來說，打開一個傳送通道並將一大群外星戰士釋放到街道上，將只會把PC們推向需要採取更多行動的情境。

這個章節詳細介紹了一些你需要知道的主持技巧，告訴你遊戲中的動作是如何串聯、相互關聯、以及流動的。


<!--## SESSION MOVES (Ignored)-->


## 戰鬥場景
Fights come up often in MASKS, so you need to be prepared for them. An 
awesome fight can be one of the most fun pieces of a game, but it can also 
test your GMing skills. You have to manage the spotlight and the flow of the 
action, the tension, the reactions of the villains...all the moving parts that make 
a fight scene fun.

### 管理聚光燈
If you have a fight scene involving every member of the team and at least one 
villain, that’s a lot of characters for you to bounce between. You’re in charge 
of the spotlight, i.e., which character is featured in any given panel of your 
comic. In game terms, that means you’re in charge of who’s acting, who has the 
chance to make a move.

When you’ve got a big fight like that, you should first see if the players have 
triggered the core team move: when you enter battle against a dangerous foe 
as a team. The move accounts for them being out of sync with each other and 
thrown off balance, so you should only avoid the move when it’s very, very 
clear they never came together as a team. This move is crucial to setting the 
scene, signaling that “This is a dangerous fight!” and getting some Team in the 
pool for the players.

When the punching starts, remember to be a fan of the PCs. You want to 
see every one of them be awesome and amazing in your fights, and you don’t 
want to see any of them neglected. 

That  said,  stay  where  the  action  is  interesting. You  don’t  have  to  give 
every single character the exact same amount of time—in fact, you probably 
shouldn’t.  If  you’re  controlling  what  the  panels  of  the  comic  book  show, 
you wouldn’t want the comic to flit around all the time, showing a different 
character with each successive panel. You’d want to see the comic stick with a 
character for a few beats before moving to the next part of the fight. 


### 營造緊張感
How  do  you  make  fights  matter?  How  do  you  make  them  feel  tense? 
Dangerous? Potentially disastrous? 

First, make moves that inflict conditions or force PCs to take powerful 
blows. Don’t do this out of nowhere, but if you’re following the fiction, there’ll 
be ample justification for both conditions and blows. Conditions lead the 
PCs to either taking interesting actions or rolling more misses, both of which 
allow you to ramp up the tension. Taking a powerful blow leads to its own 
interesting, stakes-raising outcomes. Rely heavily on those tools throughout 
the fight.

But also make fights about more than knock-outs. Sometimes the situation 
calls for a good, solid, climactic brawl, with the heroes and the villains going at 
it to see who’s standing when the dust settles. And that’s awesome! But the rest 
of the time, complicate the situation. 

Most fights shouldn’t just be about who takes out who first, but whether the 
villain can set off the Quantum Reverberator before the heroes can stop them, 
or whether the heroes can get the Mayor to safety, or whether the heroes can 
successfully capture the rampaging villain before they destroy too much of 
the city. Make GM moves that point the fight in directions other than straight 
out brawling.

### 描繪反派
You should still portray your villains as people, with their own character traits 
and contradictions. But during fights, you need to take some steps to make 
them fit the role of primary opposition. 

**First,  every  time  a  villain  marks  a  condition  during  a  fight,  they immediately make a condition move.** They can make condition moves at 
other times throughout the fight, whenever you’d make a move—but they 
always make one immediately after they take the condition. These should 
almost  always  be  softer  moves,  setting  up  future  action  and  results.  Not, 
“You punch Vanquish, he gets Angry, and he levels you with a punch, mark a 
condition,” but “You punch Vanquish, he gets Angry, and now he’s hurtling at 
you full speed with all his alien power. Stay where you’re standing and you’re 
gonna get leveled. What do you do?” 

**Second, push villains toward their drives.** Drives tell you what the villains 
are really after, and more often than not, they point you in directions slightly 
askew from straightforward conflict. Use those drives to help keep the conflicts 
interesting, and as a prompt for when villains would start to negotiate or flee.

**Third, follow the fiction.**  If the PCs nail the villain with a snide insult and 
make them start feeling a particular condition, mark off that condition and 
have the villain make a condition move. If the villain would be largely immune 
to some kind of threat or attack from the PCs, let them know—the villain just 
shrugs it off. 


## 玩家 VS 玩家
In MASKS, there may be some conflict between PCs, situations where two young 
heroes try to provoke each other or punch each other. Most of the time, PCs 
try to comfort or support each other, and they have relatively little reason to 
resist—even on a hit, the comforted or supported PC can choose to not open 
up. But even though MASKS is mostly concerned with conflict against antagonists 
and villains, sometimes the PCs will want to hit each other. That’s okay! You 
and MASKS can handle it. 

### 共享聚光燈
These situations ultimately follow many of the guidelines for fights. Share 
the spotlight between the characters and be a fan of everyone involved. You 
may flip to one PC first, as the instigator, to  directly engage a threat, but you 
need to keep shifting the focus of your panels so all the PCs involved get 
the spotlight. No PC should ever completely thrash any other just because of 
spotlight.

Remember that players usually have a fair amount of control over when 
they go down. If their conditions are full and they have to mark another, then 
they go out; but they have options besides marking conditions when they take 
powerful blows. As such, you can rely on that move to help ensure nobody 
gets taken out too quickly, too easily—the PCs may be faced with some hard choices about the costs of continuing the fight, but they probably won’t go 
down without warning.


### 抵禦和幫助
The  only  means  PCs  have  to  directly  intervene  when  another  PC  comes 
after them is to defend against a PC threat. On a 7+, the defender gives the 
opposition a -2 to their roll. Defend needs to be against an immediate threat, 
though, and with PCs against PCs, that should really be limited to dangerous 
and direct action. A PC can’t usually defend themselves when another PC tries 
to comfort or support them or pierce their mask. Resolve the first move, then 
let the target of the move make a move in response.

Other PCs can pretty much always help by spending Team from the pool. A 
PC might scream that they don’t want help, but if another PC wants to spend 
Team to help out, they get +1 to a roll. Players are encouraged to talk out of 
character about whether or not they want to spend Team.

### 玩家 VS 玩家　的範例
{{< hint info >}}
Huma’s pretty frustrated with Vertex’s nonsense, especially choosing to let La Espada 
go during their last conflict, instead of bringing her down. 

“‘So what?” says Jack as Vertex. ‘You’re not the real team leader, that’s Hornet. 
You’ve got no authority...unless you want to punch me. Is that what you want to do, 
jerk? You gonna hit me?’ I want to provoke Huma to back down. Definitely not to 
hit me!” Vertex has Influence over Huma, so that provoke definitely goes off. But 
Jack gets a miss.

“Oh, yeah, okay. So Huma, I’ll turn that around. You get a free provoke on Vertex, 
as if you’d rolled a 10+.” I’m turning the move around on Vertex, a great GM move 
in PC vs PC conflicts.

“Awesome! I want Vertex to back down. I’d love it if he apologized, but backing 
down is enough. ‘No, Vertex. I don’t have to hit you. Because you’re a coward, and 
you’re going to shut up. Right. Now,’” says Rich. 

“Ah, I can’t back down after that!” says Jack. He thinks for a second. “Yeah...I 
guess I hit Huma!” 

“Oh man,” I say. “Okay, well, first mark a condition as a result of the provoke, then 
I think you’re directly engaging a threat, right?”

“Yep. I’ll mark Angry and roll to directly engage.” Jack gets an 11. “Hah! So I get 
two options, right?”

“Hold on. I definitely want to defend myself,” says Rich. “I saw him coming a 
mile away. I try to slip out to the side and let him run into a wall.” He rolls to defend 
against an immediate threat, and gets a 9. That means he exposes himself to cost, 
retribution, or judgment, but he does drop Vertex’s roll down to a 9.

“You slip to the side, Huma, but it’s not enough. Vertex’s first punch hits the wall, 
but he rebounds quickly and catches you with a second blow.”

“I choose to resist or avoid his blows,” says Jack.

“Yep. So Huma, you can’t get a good shot in—you were probably a little startled 
by this, despite your move to slip to the side. Vertex lands a surprisingly solid punch 
to your face, but nothing too bad. Roll to take a powerful blow.” 

Rich gets an 8. He debates a few options: “No way am I giving him an opportunity. 
I’m tempted to lash out again, but my Superior’s not so good right now, so I’ll mark 
two conditions. Angry and Insecure—I’m doubting myself. I just got punched by 
Vertex.” 

“Yep. Plus, you exposed yourself to cost, retribution, or judgment, right? So yeah. 
Pick one of your teammates who’s watching and give them Influence over you,” I say.
“Oh, definitely Hornet! Vertex specifically mentioned her!” says Rich.

“Yep, so Hornet, you get Influence over Huma. Huma, you’ve got some nice hits 
on your face—nothing too bad, but boy do they sting. And you’re keenly aware of 
Hornet watching you in this fight. What do you do now?” 

“I think about stopping for a minute...but I’m coming right back at him. Time 
to show him what it means to be Huma. I want to directly engage and just lay him 
out on the ground.” 

And the fight continues…
{{< /hint >}}

Don’t hesitate to let these dramatic confrontations play out—but remember, 
plenty of interesting things can happen to break these fights up. If there are 
other PCs there, they get the spotlight, too! They can try to interfere, defend 
one teammate or the other. If someone gets a miss, they might get attacked by a 
villain or interrupted by something else dangerous—that happens all the time 
in comics. Use these tools to help ensure PC vs PC conflicts don’t run too long 
or take up too much of your attention in the game as a whole.

# 當你沒那麼忙的時候……
These tips and tricks aren’t crucial to running MASKS successfully—you’ll be fine 
if you stick to the agendas, principles, and moves earlier in this chapter. But 
these may give you some tools to take your game to the next level!

**Use splash panels.** In comics, splash panels are gigantic panels, taking 
up the whole page or even two pages, intricately drawn and showing off 
the detailed awesome of something. When you feel like something is super 
cool—some crazy heroic maneuver or some really cool fixture of the setting—
describe it in detail like a splash panel. 

**Draw maps.** They don’t have to be works of art—they just have to help you 
clarify the situation. What’s where. What’s at stake. Draw them on whatever’s 
available—again, don’t worry too much about quality here. The point is to 
give you all the information you need to share the fictional mindscape during 
complicated situations.

**Fill in the backstory.** Ask questions about the past. Definitely the PCs’ 
own pasts, but the past of Halcyon City, too. Only ask questions the PCs 
would actually know the answers too, but keep in mind that a huge portion of 
Halcyon City’s superhuman history is public knowledge. Fill in your Halcyon 
City with these answers, and build on them.

**Use time jumps.** If things seem to be slowing down, jump forward in time, 
especially between sessions. It doesn’t have to be very long—even a week or 
two lets you move things to a different place, as well as trigger a few of the PCs’ 
moves based on the passage of time. 

**Share the spotlight.** Your comic is about the whole team, so shift between 
them, especially when someone hasn’t spoken up in a while. Cut back and forth 
between multiple scenes, too, to keep tension up and to give everyone some 
spotlight. Make sure all the main characters in your comic get their chance to 
show up in your panels.

**Take breaks.** While playing, take breaks, especially when you’re not exactly 
sure what should happen next. Take a few minutes to think about it, and come 
back refreshed. Don’t hesitate to end the session at a time that feels right, even 
if it’s a bit early. Don’t push yourself too hard—keep up your own interest by 
giving yourself reprieves.
