# CHAIN REACTIONS
The  moves  in  MASKS  are  designed  to  link  together.  One  move  ends  and 
immediately sets up a new move. Partial hits (7-9 results) in particular push 
the  situation  towards  unresolved  tension—you  don’t  flat  out  take  down 
Tentacular Doom, you hurt the monster instead, then it hurts you, and you 
push the creature to a place where you might have a chance to knock it out 
of the city, and so on. Even misses often require reaction, and that reaction 
pushes towards new moves. That’s how you get tense, effective, interesting 
scenes across the board—but it’s also how you get awesome fight scenes. Each 
punch leads to another change in the scene, which leads to another punch.

As the GM, you control how much the moves snowball. Some things you 
can say will lead to a chain reaction of moves more than others—if you capture 
a PC for instance, that ends the chain reaction, whereas opening a portal that 
releases alien warriors onto the streets will only push the PCs to further action. 

This section details a few other things you need to know about how some 
of the moves of the game connect, interrelate, and flow.


<!--## SESSION MOVES (Ignored)-->


## FIGHT SCENES
Fights come up often in MASKS, so you need to be prepared for them. An 
awesome fight can be one of the most fun pieces of a game, but it can also 
test your GMing skills. You have to manage the spotlight and the flow of the 
action, the tension, the reactions of the villains...all the moving parts that make 
a fight scene fun.

### MANAGING THE SPOTLIGHT
If you have a fight scene involving every member of the team and at least one 
villain, that’s a lot of characters for you to bounce between. You’re in charge 
of the spotlight, i.e., which character is featured in any given panel of your 
comic. In game terms, that means you’re in charge of who’s acting, who has the 
chance to make a move.

When you’ve got a big fight like that, you should first see if the players have 
triggered the core team move: when you enter battle against a dangerous foe 
as a team. The move accounts for them being out of sync with each other and 
thrown off balance, so you should only avoid the move when it’s very, very 
clear they never came together as a team. This move is crucial to setting the 
scene, signaling that “This is a dangerous fight!” and getting some Team in the 
pool for the players.

When the punching starts, remember to be a fan of the PCs. You want to 
see every one of them be awesome and amazing in your fights, and you don’t 
want to see any of them neglected. 

That  said,  stay  where  the  action  is  interesting. You  don’t  have  to  give 
every single character the exact same amount of time—in fact, you probably 
shouldn’t.  If  you’re  controlling  what  the  panels  of  the  comic  book  show, 
you wouldn’t want the comic to flit around all the time, showing a different 
character with each successive panel. You’d want to see the comic stick with a 
character for a few beats before moving to the next part of the fight. 


### CRAFTING TENSION
How  do  you  make  fights  matter?  How  do  you  make  them  feel  tense? 
Dangerous? Potentially disastrous? 

First, make moves that inflict conditions or force PCs to take powerful 
blows. Don’t do this out of nowhere, but if you’re following the fiction, there’ll 
be ample justification for both conditions and blows. Conditions lead the 
PCs to either taking interesting actions or rolling more misses, both of which 
allow you to ramp up the tension. Taking a powerful blow leads to its own 
interesting, stakes-raising outcomes. Rely heavily on those tools throughout 
the fight.

But also make fights about more than knock-outs. Sometimes the situation 
calls for a good, solid, climactic brawl, with the heroes and the villains going at 
it to see who’s standing when the dust settles. And that’s awesome! But the rest 
of the time, complicate the situation. 

Most fights shouldn’t just be about who takes out who first, but whether the 
villain can set off the Quantum Reverberator before the heroes can stop them, 
or whether the heroes can get the Mayor to safety, or whether the heroes can 
successfully capture the rampaging villain before they destroy too much of 
the city. Make GM moves that point the fight in directions other than straight 
out brawling.

### PORTRAYING VILLAINS
You should still portray your villains as people, with their own character traits 
and contradictions. But during fights, you need to take some steps to make 
them fit the role of primary opposition. 

**First,  every  time  a  villain  marks  a  condition  during  a  fight,  they immediately make a condition move.** They can make condition moves at 
other times throughout the fight, whenever you’d make a move—but they 
always make one immediately after they take the condition. These should 
almost  always  be  softer  moves,  setting  up  future  action  and  results.  Not, 
“You punch Vanquish, he gets Angry, and he levels you with a punch, mark a 
condition,” but “You punch Vanquish, he gets Angry, and now he’s hurtling at 
you full speed with all his alien power. Stay where you’re standing and you’re 
gonna get leveled. What do you do?” 

**Second, push villains toward their drives.** Drives tell you what the villains 
are really after, and more often than not, they point you in directions slightly 
askew from straightforward conflict. Use those drives to help keep the conflicts 
interesting, and as a prompt for when villains would start to negotiate or flee.

**Third, follow the fiction.**  If the PCs nail the villain with a snide insult and 
make them start feeling a particular condition, mark off that condition and 
have the villain make a condition move. If the villain would be largely immune 
to some kind of threat or attack from the PCs, let them know—the villain just 
shrugs it off. 


## PC VS PC
In MASKS, there may be some conflict between PCs, situations where two young 
heroes try to provoke each other or punch each other. Most of the time, PCs 
try to comfort or support each other, and they have relatively little reason to 
resist—even on a hit, the comforted or supported PC can choose to not open 
up. But even though MASKS is mostly concerned with conflict against antagonists 
and villains, sometimes the PCs will want to hit each other. That’s okay! You 
and MASKS can handle it. 

### SHARING SPOTLIGHT
These situations ultimately follow many of the guidelines for fights. Share 
the spotlight between the characters and be a fan of everyone involved. You 
may flip to one PC first, as the instigator, to  directly engage a threat, but you 
need to keep shifting the focus of your panels so all the PCs involved get 
the spotlight. No PC should ever completely thrash any other just because of 
spotlight.

Remember that players usually have a fair amount of control over when 
they go down. If their conditions are full and they have to mark another, then 
they go out; but they have options besides marking conditions when they take 
powerful blows. As such, you can rely on that move to help ensure nobody 
gets taken out too quickly, too easily—the PCs may be faced with some hard choices about the costs of continuing the fight, but they probably won’t go 
down without warning.


### DEFENDING AND BOOSTING
The  only  means  PCs  have  to  directly  intervene  when  another  PC  comes 
after them is to defend against a PC threat. On a 7+, the defender gives the 
opposition a -2 to their roll. Defend needs to be against an immediate threat, 
though, and with PCs against PCs, that should really be limited to dangerous 
and direct action. A PC can’t usually defend themselves when another PC tries 
to comfort or support them or pierce their mask. Resolve the first move, then 
let the target of the move make a move in response.

Other PCs can pretty much always help by spending Team from the pool. A 
PC might scream that they don’t want help, but if another PC wants to spend 
Team to help out, they get +1 to a roll. Players are encouraged to talk out of 
character about whether or not they want to spend Team.

### PLAYER VS PLAYER EXAMPLE
{{< hint info >}}
Huma’s pretty frustrated with Vertex’s nonsense, especially choosing to let La Espada 
go during their last conflict, instead of bringing her down. 

“‘So what?” says Jack as Vertex. ‘You’re not the real team leader, that’s Hornet. 
You’ve got no authority...unless you want to punch me. Is that what you want to do, 
jerk? You gonna hit me?’ I want to provoke Huma to back down. Definitely not to 
hit me!” Vertex has Influence over Huma, so that provoke definitely goes off. But 
Jack gets a miss.

“Oh, yeah, okay. So Huma, I’ll turn that around. You get a free provoke on Vertex, 
as if you’d rolled a 10+.” I’m turning the move around on Vertex, a great GM move 
in PC vs PC conflicts.

“Awesome! I want Vertex to back down. I’d love it if he apologized, but backing 
down is enough. ‘No, Vertex. I don’t have to hit you. Because you’re a coward, and 
you’re going to shut up. Right. Now,’” says Rich. 

“Ah, I can’t back down after that!” says Jack. He thinks for a second. “Yeah...I 
guess I hit Huma!” 

“Oh man,” I say. “Okay, well, first mark a condition as a result of the provoke, then 
I think you’re directly engaging a threat, right?”

“Yep. I’ll mark Angry and roll to directly engage.” Jack gets an 11. “Hah! So I get 
two options, right?”

“Hold on. I definitely want to defend myself,” says Rich. “I saw him coming a 
mile away. I try to slip out to the side and let him run into a wall.” He rolls to defend 
against an immediate threat, and gets a 9. That means he exposes himself to cost, 
retribution, or judgment, but he does drop Vertex’s roll down to a 9.

“You slip to the side, Huma, but it’s not enough. Vertex’s first punch hits the wall, 
but he rebounds quickly and catches you with a second blow.”

“I choose to resist or avoid his blows,” says Jack.

“Yep. So Huma, you can’t get a good shot in—you were probably a little startled 
by this, despite your move to slip to the side. Vertex lands a surprisingly solid punch 
to your face, but nothing too bad. Roll to take a powerful blow.” 

Rich gets an 8. He debates a few options: “No way am I giving him an opportunity. 
I’m tempted to lash out again, but my Superior’s not so good right now, so I’ll mark 
two conditions. Angry and Insecure—I’m doubting myself. I just got punched by 
Vertex.” 

“Yep. Plus, you exposed yourself to cost, retribution, or judgment, right? So yeah. 
Pick one of your teammates who’s watching and give them Influence over you,” I say.
“Oh, definitely Hornet! Vertex specifically mentioned her!” says Rich.

“Yep, so Hornet, you get Influence over Huma. Huma, you’ve got some nice hits 
on your face—nothing too bad, but boy do they sting. And you’re keenly aware of 
Hornet watching you in this fight. What do you do now?” 

“I think about stopping for a minute...but I’m coming right back at him. Time 
to show him what it means to be Huma. I want to directly engage and just lay him 
out on the ground.” 

And the fight continues…
{{< /hint >}}

Don’t hesitate to let these dramatic confrontations play out—but remember, 
plenty of interesting things can happen to break these fights up. If there are 
other PCs there, they get the spotlight, too! They can try to interfere, defend 
one teammate or the other. If someone gets a miss, they might get attacked by a 
villain or interrupted by something else dangerous—that happens all the time 
in comics. Use these tools to help ensure PC vs PC conflicts don’t run too long 
or take up too much of your attention in the game as a whole.

# USING NPCs IN PLAY
Halcyon City is packed with people for you to put in your game. To create an 
NPC, give them a name, think about how they look—maybe one distinctive 
mannerism or physical trait—and a one-word synopsis of how they act. That’s 
all you need to start! Later, you can add more to flesh ’em out—abilities if 
they’re superhuman, or a drive to tell you what they want.

## DRIVES
An easy way to give an NPC more detail is to give them a drive: a simple 
statement of what they want. Always phrase a drive as a “To ______” sentence: 
“To make tons of money”; “To become the new mayor”; “To avenge my sister.” 
When you need to say what an NPC does, look at their drive—they’ll always 
angle for an action that in some way brings them closer to accomplishing their 
drive, though more manipulative NPCs may be subtler about it.

## PC-NPC-PC TRIANGLES
As often as possible, create PC-NPC-PC triangles—webs of relationships in 
which two PCs have fundamentally different connections to the same NPC. 

The Janus’s sister? Yeah, she’s totally got a crush on the Nova. And the 
Legacy’s mom adores her daughter, but hates that problematic Delinquent—
and had herself made the Delinquent’s parole officer, just to keep an eye on the 
guy. That former reformed supervillain is helping the Doomed to potentially 
overcome her doom, but the Protégé knows that the supervillain was the most 
dangerous foe her mentor ever fought. And so on, and so forth. 

When possible, reuse an NPC instead of creating a new one, so you can 
create these triangles for your PCs.

## NPC CONDITIONS
For the most part, NPCs don’t have that many conditions to mark. The only 
real way they mark conditions is if a PC directly engaged them, and only 
NPCs with real abilities ever count as threats for that move to trigger—and 
they’re probably villains. (More on villains in a moment.) So don’t worry about 
tracking conditions for anyone except the villains—everybody else simply 
reacts according to the fiction.

## NPC INFLUENCE
All adult NPCs have Influence over PCs by default, so you don’t have to track 
much when it comes to Influence. They can still lose and gain Influence, so if 
they ever do, mark that in your notes.

Young  NPCs,  the  same  age  as  the  PCs,  don’t  automatically  start  with 
Influence over the PCs. But you can ask the PCs if their peers have Influence 
over them, and record it appropriately.

You can and should use Influence all the time for your NPCs. They can tell 
the PCs who they are and how the world works left and right, shifting the PCs’ 
Labels and giving cause to reject Influence. If it ever feels like a good moment 
for an NPC to say something that could shift a PC’s Labels, go for it.

## ADULTS
Most of your NPCs will probably be adults, older than the PCs. Remember 
to make adults seem childish and short-sighted—there’s a good chance your 
natural tendency will pull you in the opposite direction. 

In  general,  adults  are  older,  probably  more  experienced,  maybe  even 
wiser—but they’re all still flawed and sometimes vulnerable individuals. They 
just have a tendency to hide their emotions more, to let them simmer inside 
instead of letting them burst out all at once. Play up the dichotomy. Don’t have 
your adults be explicitly jerks or wonderful people—have them be both.

# VILLAINS
Villain is a catch-all term for the main antagonists in your story. Sometimes 
villains  are  straight-up  monsters;  other  times,  they  have  all  too  human 
motivations. You might even have a “villain” who’s actually one of the city’s 
biggest heroes! A villain is simply an NPC important enough—and threatening 
enough—to get an in-depth workup as an antagonist in your game. 

Villains follow the basic rules for NPCs. Build triangles around them, and 
give them drives in exactly the same way. But there some additional steps for 
setting up a villain. 

## HOW TO MAKE A VILLAIN
Follow these steps to set up a villain, whether making one from scratch or 
writing up an existing character as a villain:

* Choose a name and generation
* Choose a drive
* Choose one to five villain moves
* Choose one to five conditions

#### VILLAIN NAMES
Choose a name that’s fun and exciting to you, and that signals the generation of the villain.

* Gold: Goofy, fun, light-hearted names
* Silver: Grandiose, cosmic, epic names
* Bronze: Down-to-earth, simple, catchy names
* Modern: Meme-worthy, “unique,” clever names

When it’s appropriate, pick a real name for the villain, too.

#### VILLAIN DRIVES
Give your villain a drive, a purpose or goal that leads them to action, in the form of a statement: 

“To __________________.” This is the same as giving any NPC a drive, 
but for villains especially, make your drives point at the villain’s underlying 
humanity.  Instead  of “To  travel  through  time,”  go  with “To  correct  past 
mistakes.” Make the drives comprehensible and empathetic whenever possible.

#### VILLAIN MOVES
Create three or so villain moves, things the villain does, both 
in and out of fights. Make them descriptive and interesting. Not 
punch hard, but fire a cosmic punch at the most dangerous 
target.  The  villain  moves  remind  you  of  some  of  the 
villain’s  signature  actions  while  you  use  them  in  a 
conflict—more descriptive moves give you more to 
work with.

Generally try to make them active and direct, 
focused  on  the  change  to  the  fiction  that  they 
create. Not, create a gravitational rift, but pull an 
enemy into a gravitational rift. The former is neat, 
but also unclear—exactly what happens next? But 
the latter makes clear exactly what happens. 

#### CONDITIONS
Choose  one  to  five  conditions  for  the villain. You choose from the PC’s regular conditions  list:  Afraid,  Angry,  Guilty, 
Hopeless,  and  Insecure.  The  more conditions  you  give  a  villain,  the greater  their  capacity  to  stay in  the  fight,  and  the  more dangerous they’ll be. 

* 1 condition: barely a threat
* 2 conditions: bit of a fight
* 3 conditions:  threatening villain
* 4 conditions:  dangerous villain
* 5 conditions:  true arch-villain

You  can  always adjust a villain’s danger and longevity by giving them more conditions or taking away conditions.

#### EXAMPLE VILLAIN
{{< details title="EXAMPLE VILLAIN" >}}
{{< hint info >}}
First, I choose the villain’s name and generation. I want a powerful villain who’s 
been around for a while, so I pick the Silver generation. I want a name that sounds 
menacing and over-the-top: I settle on the Dread Queen. I can give her a real name 
later, if I need one. 

Then I give the villain a drive. The Dread Queen is forming in my head as a regal 
villain, arrogant and in charge of some nation. I think she enacts grandiose plans, 
but ultimately, she’s driven by a relatable urge: “To protect and grow her sovereign 
nation.” Next, I give the Dread Queen some villain moves. I stick with three for 
now—if I really feel the need for more later, I can add them on.

* Reveal a dangerous high-tech weapon or doomsday device 
* Unveil the perfect countermeasure or counter strategy
* Twist probabilities in her favor with her Quantum Circlet

Next, I give the Dread Queen four conditions to show how dangerous she is: 
Angry, Guilty, Hopeless, and Insecure. The Dread Queen is never Afraid.

I jot down some notes about who exactly she is—a monarch from another 
dimension who came to Halcyon City during a multidimensional shift. Her country 
came with her and floats in the ocean near the city. Halcyon is her first target for 
conquest.

And she’s all set and ready to go!

## VILLAINS IN A FIGHT
Here are the core guidelines that villains follow in fights: 

* When a villain gets hit hard, by trading blows or in other situations, they mark a condition as appropriate.
* When a villain marks a condition, they make a move from the condition moves list immediately, before the PCs act again.
* When  you  need  to  say  what  the  villain  does  next,  look  to  your  GM moves, their villain moves, and the condition moves.
* When a villain needs to mark a condition but can’t, they are defeated. 
* Villains can flee or give up long before all their conditions are filled—don’t think they have to fight to the bitter end.

Villains, and NPCs in general, always try to clear conditions—they always choose to open up after a PC’s successful comfort or support move.

Beyond always seeking to clear conditions as the result of a PC’s successful 
comfort  or  support  move,  villains  clear  conditions  when  you  think  it 
fictionally  appropriate,  most  likely  after  time  has  passed ( page  86)  and 
they’ve had the chance to get over their feelings.


## CONDITION MOVES
These are GM moves for villains to make immediately after they’ve marked a 
condition, and any time you’d make a GM move after that. 

#### AFRAID
* Hide out of harm’s way
* Flee from danger or difficulty
* Lash out without thought at a threat
* Plead for mercy
* Throw up blocks and walls

The Afraid condition moves are about blocking and fleeing, about escaping 
from danger, with the exception of lash out without thought at a threat. Mark 
Afraid for a villain if you want them to try to escape or protect their interests. 

#### ANGRY
* Vent through unthinking violence
* Break the environment
* Shut down conversation
* Lash out at any vulnerability
* Escalate the situation dangerously

The Angry condition moves are about intense overreaction and amplifying 
the situation. Mark Angry for a villain if you want them to fight and struggle 
dangerously.

#### GUILTY
* Seek forgiveness
* Sacrifice anything or everything for redemption
* Turn to the unthinkable
* Implicate others in guilt
* Reveal the nature of their drive

The Guilty condition moves are about making the villain more relatable 
and human. They let you try to redeem a villain or to show an inner pain that 
pushes them to drastic action. Mark Guilty for a villain if they understand 
the terrible nature of the things they do, but aren’t sure what else they can do.

#### HOPELESS
* Give up without a fight
* Burn down the world around them
* Seek any light in the dark
* Undermine others’ beliefs
* Veer toward drastic and terrible action

The Hopeless condition moves are about escalation or de-escalation. They 
let you make the villain give up, or take an outstretched hero’s hand...or they 
let you make the villain escalate in terrible ways. Mark Hopeless for a villain if 
they’re losing badly, and you want to either ratchet the overall tension or bring 
things to a close.

#### INSECURE
* Double down on broken plans or ideas
* Follow the lead of someone else
* Doubt and question their own allies and plans
* Admit wrongful action
* Recede into the background

The Insecure condition moves are about social interaction. They let you 
make a villain talk, explain, or interact on a level other than conflict and 
violence. Mark Insecure for a villain if they doubt themselves and those around 
them, and you’re interested in having a different kind of interaction.

# WHEN YOU’RE NOT BUSY
These tips and tricks aren’t crucial to running MASKS successfully—you’ll be fine 
if you stick to the agendas, principles, and moves earlier in this chapter. But 
these may give you some tools to take your game to the next level!

**Use splash panels.** In comics, splash panels are gigantic panels, taking 
up the whole page or even two pages, intricately drawn and showing off 
the detailed awesome of something. When you feel like something is super 
cool—some crazy heroic maneuver or some really cool fixture of the setting—
describe it in detail like a splash panel. 

**Draw maps.** They don’t have to be works of art—they just have to help you 
clarify the situation. What’s where. What’s at stake. Draw them on whatever’s 
available—again, don’t worry too much about quality here. The point is to 
give you all the information you need to share the fictional mindscape during 
complicated situations.

**Fill in the backstory.** Ask questions about the past. Definitely the PCs’ 
own pasts, but the past of Halcyon City, too. Only ask questions the PCs 
would actually know the answers too, but keep in mind that a huge portion of 
Halcyon City’s superhuman history is public knowledge. Fill in your Halcyon 
City with these answers, and build on them.

**Use time jumps.** If things seem to be slowing down, jump forward in time, 
especially between sessions. It doesn’t have to be very long—even a week or 
two lets you move things to a different place, as well as trigger a few of the PCs’ 
moves based on the passage of time. 

**Share the spotlight.** Your comic is about the whole team, so shift between 
them, especially when someone hasn’t spoken up in a while. Cut back and forth 
between multiple scenes, too, to keep tension up and to give everyone some 
spotlight. Make sure all the main characters in your comic get their chance to 
show up in your panels.

**Take breaks.** While playing, take breaks, especially when you’re not exactly 
sure what should happen next. Take a few minutes to think about it, and come 
back refreshed. Don’t hesitate to end the session at a time that feels right, even 
if it’s a bit early. Don’t push yourself too hard—keep up your own interest by 
giving yourself reprieves.
