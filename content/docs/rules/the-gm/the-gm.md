# 擔任GM
If you’re reading this, you’re probably the person who’s running the game for 
your group. You’re the Gamemaster—the GM, for short. 

The rest of the players are focused on their one character. Their job is to 
make that character interesting, compelling, cool, complicated, and so on. To 
play that character to the hilt, and to own their decisions.

You? You’re responsible for most everything else. It’s sorta like you’re the 
cosmic being behind the scenes, controlling the entire universe with your 
phlogiston-powered puppet strings, laughing maniacally every now and then.
It’s a pretty cool gig.

You’re here to toss out diabolical villains and dangerous villains, and watch 
the heroes knock ’em down. You’re here to punch these PCs where it hurts, and 
revel in the drama. You’re here to push them to the brink, and see who they 
become under that titanic pressure. You’re here to surprise the players, to shift 
things in directions they might never have seen coming, and to be entertained 
by the surprising things they choose to do.

## HOW DO I DO THAT?
Well, that’s what this chapter’s for. It tells you what you should be doing as a 
GM for MASKS. This is the way to make the game sing—go with it. 

You should’ve read the other chapters before you get here, so you know 
all the main pieces of the game. You don’t have to have memorized them or 
anything, but that information should be floating around in your noggin. 

This chapter gives you the rules for your side of the conversation. Agendas 
are your overall goals in running the game, and they aim you at the best kind 
of play for MASKS. Principles give you the best practices for running the game. 
Moves are specific things you can say in response to the players’ choices. 
Together, these make up the structure for how to GM MASKS in a fun, dramatic, 
and interesting way that fits the themes and style of the game.

This chapter also includes myriad other tidbits of import, including:
* How to create villains (page 155)
* How to run specific playbooks (page 160)
* How to foster a superheroic style, including fight scenes (page 146)

Again, you don’t have to memorize this whole chapter before you play, 
so don’t try. Plan on coming back to this chapter a few times, to refresh and 
inform yourself of what you should be doing.
