# USING NPCs IN PLAY
Halcyon City is packed with people for you to put in your game. To create an 
NPC, give them a name, think about how they look—maybe one distinctive 
mannerism or physical trait—and a one-word synopsis of how they act. That’s 
all you need to start! Later, you can add more to flesh ’em out—abilities if 
they’re superhuman, or a drive to tell you what they want.

## DRIVES
An easy way to give an NPC more detail is to give them a drive: a simple 
statement of what they want. Always phrase a drive as a “To ______” sentence: 
“To make tons of money”; “To become the new mayor”; “To avenge my sister.” 
When you need to say what an NPC does, look at their drive—they’ll always 
angle for an action that in some way brings them closer to accomplishing their 
drive, though more manipulative NPCs may be subtler about it.

## PC-NPC-PC TRIANGLES
As often as possible, create PC-NPC-PC triangles—webs of relationships in 
which two PCs have fundamentally different connections to the same NPC. 

The Janus’s sister? Yeah, she’s totally got a crush on the Nova. And the 
Legacy’s mom adores her daughter, but hates that problematic Delinquent—
and had herself made the Delinquent’s parole officer, just to keep an eye on the 
guy. That former reformed supervillain is helping the Doomed to potentially 
overcome her doom, but the Protégé knows that the supervillain was the most 
dangerous foe her mentor ever fought. And so on, and so forth. 

When possible, reuse an NPC instead of creating a new one, so you can 
create these triangles for your PCs.

## NPC CONDITIONS
For the most part, NPCs don’t have that many conditions to mark. The only 
real way they mark conditions is if a PC directly engaged them, and only 
NPCs with real abilities ever count as threats for that move to trigger—and 
they’re probably villains. (More on villains in a moment.) So don’t worry about 
tracking conditions for anyone except the villains—everybody else simply 
reacts according to the fiction.

## NPC INFLUENCE
All adult NPCs have Influence over PCs by default, so you don’t have to track 
much when it comes to Influence. They can still lose and gain Influence, so if 
they ever do, mark that in your notes.

Young  NPCs,  the  same  age  as  the  PCs,  don’t  automatically  start  with 
Influence over the PCs. But you can ask the PCs if their peers have Influence 
over them, and record it appropriately.

You can and should use Influence all the time for your NPCs. They can tell 
the PCs who they are and how the world works left and right, shifting the PCs’ 
Labels and giving cause to reject Influence. If it ever feels like a good moment 
for an NPC to say something that could shift a PC’s Labels, go for it.

## ADULTS
Most of your NPCs will probably be adults, older than the PCs. Remember 
to make adults seem childish and short-sighted—there’s a good chance your 
natural tendency will pull you in the opposite direction. 

In  general,  adults  are  older,  probably  more  experienced,  maybe  even 
wiser—but they’re all still flawed and sometimes vulnerable individuals. They 
just have a tendency to hide their emotions more, to let them simmer inside 
instead of letting them burst out all at once. Play up the dichotomy. Don’t have 
your adults be explicitly jerks or wonderful people—have them be both.

# VILLAINS
Villain is a catch-all term for the main antagonists in your story. Sometimes 
villains  are  straight-up  monsters;  other  times,  they  have  all  too  human 
motivations. You might even have a “villain” who’s actually one of the city’s 
biggest heroes! A villain is simply an NPC important enough—and threatening 
enough—to get an in-depth workup as an antagonist in your game. 

Villains follow the basic rules for NPCs. Build triangles around them, and 
give them drives in exactly the same way. But there some additional steps for 
setting up a villain. 

## HOW TO MAKE A VILLAIN
Follow these steps to set up a villain, whether making one from scratch or 
writing up an existing character as a villain:

* Choose a name and generation
* Choose a drive
* Choose one to five villain moves
* Choose one to five conditions

#### VILLAIN NAMES
Choose a name that’s fun and exciting to you, and that signals the generation of the villain.

* Gold: Goofy, fun, light-hearted names
* Silver: Grandiose, cosmic, epic names
* Bronze: Down-to-earth, simple, catchy names
* Modern: Meme-worthy, “unique,” clever names

When it’s appropriate, pick a real name for the villain, too.

#### VILLAIN DRIVES
Give your villain a drive, a purpose or goal that leads them to action, in the form of a statement: 

“To __________________.” This is the same as giving any NPC a drive, 
but for villains especially, make your drives point at the villain’s underlying 
humanity.  Instead  of “To  travel  through  time,”  go  with “To  correct  past 
mistakes.” Make the drives comprehensible and empathetic whenever possible.

#### VILLAIN MOVES
Create three or so villain moves, things the villain does, both 
in and out of fights. Make them descriptive and interesting. Not 
punch hard, but fire a cosmic punch at the most dangerous 
target.  The  villain  moves  remind  you  of  some  of  the 
villain’s  signature  actions  while  you  use  them  in  a 
conflict—more descriptive moves give you more to 
work with.

Generally try to make them active and direct, 
focused  on  the  change  to  the  fiction  that  they 
create. Not, create a gravitational rift, but pull an 
enemy into a gravitational rift. The former is neat, 
but also unclear—exactly what happens next? But 
the latter makes clear exactly what happens. 

#### CONDITIONS
Choose  one  to  five  conditions  for  the villain. You choose from the PC’s regular conditions  list:  Afraid,  Angry,  Guilty, 
Hopeless,  and  Insecure.  The  more conditions  you  give  a  villain,  the greater  their  capacity  to  stay in  the  fight,  and  the  more dangerous they’ll be. 

* 1 condition: barely a threat
* 2 conditions: bit of a fight
* 3 conditions:  threatening villain
* 4 conditions:  dangerous villain
* 5 conditions:  true arch-villain

You  can  always adjust a villain’s danger and longevity by giving them more conditions or taking away conditions.

#### EXAMPLE VILLAIN
{{< details title="EXAMPLE VILLAIN" >}}
{{< hint info >}}
First, I choose the villain’s name and generation. I want a powerful villain who’s 
been around for a while, so I pick the Silver generation. I want a name that sounds 
menacing and over-the-top: I settle on the Dread Queen. I can give her a real name 
later, if I need one. 

Then I give the villain a drive. The Dread Queen is forming in my head as a regal 
villain, arrogant and in charge of some nation. I think she enacts grandiose plans, 
but ultimately, she’s driven by a relatable urge: “To protect and grow her sovereign 
nation.” Next, I give the Dread Queen some villain moves. I stick with three for 
now—if I really feel the need for more later, I can add them on.

* Reveal a dangerous high-tech weapon or doomsday device 
* Unveil the perfect countermeasure or counter strategy
* Twist probabilities in her favor with her Quantum Circlet

Next, I give the Dread Queen four conditions to show how dangerous she is: 
Angry, Guilty, Hopeless, and Insecure. The Dread Queen is never Afraid.

I jot down some notes about who exactly she is—a monarch from another 
dimension who came to Halcyon City during a multidimensional shift. Her country 
came with her and floats in the ocean near the city. Halcyon is her first target for 
conquest.

And she’s all set and ready to go!

## VILLAINS IN A FIGHT
Here are the core guidelines that villains follow in fights: 

* When a villain gets hit hard, by trading blows or in other situations, they mark a condition as appropriate.
* When a villain marks a condition, they make a move from the condition moves list immediately, before the PCs act again.
* When  you  need  to  say  what  the  villain  does  next,  look  to  your  GM moves, their villain moves, and the condition moves.
* When a villain needs to mark a condition but can’t, they are defeated. 
* Villains can flee or give up long before all their conditions are filled—don’t think they have to fight to the bitter end.

Villains, and NPCs in general, always try to clear conditions—they always choose to open up after a PC’s successful comfort or support move.

Beyond always seeking to clear conditions as the result of a PC’s successful 
comfort  or  support  move,  villains  clear  conditions  when  you  think  it 
fictionally  appropriate,  most  likely  after  time  has  passed ( page  86)  and 
they’ve had the chance to get over their feelings.


## CONDITION MOVES
These are GM moves for villains to make immediately after they’ve marked a 
condition, and any time you’d make a GM move after that. 

#### AFRAID
* Hide out of harm’s way
* Flee from danger or difficulty
* Lash out without thought at a threat
* Plead for mercy
* Throw up blocks and walls

The Afraid condition moves are about blocking and fleeing, about escaping 
from danger, with the exception of lash out without thought at a threat. Mark 
Afraid for a villain if you want them to try to escape or protect their interests. 

#### ANGRY
* Vent through unthinking violence
* Break the environment
* Shut down conversation
* Lash out at any vulnerability
* Escalate the situation dangerously

The Angry condition moves are about intense overreaction and amplifying 
the situation. Mark Angry for a villain if you want them to fight and struggle 
dangerously.

#### GUILTY
* Seek forgiveness
* Sacrifice anything or everything for redemption
* Turn to the unthinkable
* Implicate others in guilt
* Reveal the nature of their drive

The Guilty condition moves are about making the villain more relatable 
and human. They let you try to redeem a villain or to show an inner pain that 
pushes them to drastic action. Mark Guilty for a villain if they understand 
the terrible nature of the things they do, but aren’t sure what else they can do.

#### HOPELESS
* Give up without a fight
* Burn down the world around them
* Seek any light in the dark
* Undermine others’ beliefs
* Veer toward drastic and terrible action

The Hopeless condition moves are about escalation or de-escalation. They 
let you make the villain give up, or take an outstretched hero’s hand...or they 
let you make the villain escalate in terrible ways. Mark Hopeless for a villain if 
they’re losing badly, and you want to either ratchet the overall tension or bring 
things to a close.

#### INSECURE
* Double down on broken plans or ideas
* Follow the lead of someone else
* Doubt and question their own allies and plans
* Admit wrongful action
* Recede into the background

The Insecure condition moves are about social interaction. They let you 
make a villain talk, explain, or interact on a level other than conflict and 
violence. Mark Insecure for a villain if they doubt themselves and those around 
them, and you’re interested in having a different kind of interaction.
