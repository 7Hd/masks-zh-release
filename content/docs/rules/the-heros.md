# 創建英雄角色

## 選擇一個扮演書
你在《蒙面少俠》中所創建的角色將會是這個故事中的主角，是你漫畫中的主演。為了確保角色陣容足夠有趣，《蒙面少俠》使用了「扮演書」幫助你創建角色：每一個扮演書都描繪著年輕英雄故事中某個特定角色類型的基本骨架。在核心規則中總共有十個核心扮演書，分別是：「明燈」、「蠻牛」、「不良少年」、「命帶天劫者」、「雙面人」、「傳承者」、「新星」、「外來者」、「門徒」、和「異變者」。當然，你在別處也能找到其他限定版本和粉絲創作的扮演書。

每個玩家（除了GM之外）都需要在遊戲開始時挑選一個扮演書，並用其來創建自己的角色。每個玩家都必須挑選不同的扮演書，不能重複；這是因為《蒙面少俠》相當注重這些年輕英雄們之間交互的團隊互動，所以為了強化各個角色之間的互動張力，團隊成員都必須獨特且不同。如果有兩個玩家都想要同一個扮演書，那麼GM可以建議他們使用其他相似的扮演書、或讓他們用擲硬幣或丟骰子的方式來處理爭議。

扮演書並不會死死限制你扮演的角色究竟是什麼樣子；它僅僅提供了一個有趣的起點，讓你能設計出各種截然不同的角色、但都能讓其貼合《蒙面少俠》風格和主題。每個扮演書都包裝著一系列它們各自要探討的議題、糾葛、和主題。而最重要的，是你必須樂意於你的選擇。關於更多關於各個扮演書以及其探討議題的說明，請參閱其他章節。


### 我該怎麼創建我最喜歡的角色？
If you approach the playbooks saying, “I want to play my favorite character 
from comics. How do I do that?” they might seem too restrictive. But each 
playbook is more open than it might look at a glance. They give you boundaries 
for your sandbox, or a skeleton to build your character on top of. The specifics 
are largely left up to your own interpretation and choices in the fiction. 

The playbooks are flexible: the Nova playbook is about power and how 
you manage it—but that doesn’t mean the Nova must be a particular kind 
of character with a particular kind of powers. They might be a mutant with 
extraordinary psychic powers; a cosmic entity embodied in human form with 
powers over the fundamental forces of the universe; or a young witch on track 
to become the most powerful sorceress in the entire multiverse. 

The  playbooks  are  primarily  about  the  kind  of  story  the  character  is 
involved with, the dramatic issues they’re likely to face. If you have an idea 
for a particular kind of character, talk with your GM and your group to see if 
it makes sense for the playbook—chances are, there’s a way to make it work. 

### 拼湊出神翠市的樣貌
The openness of the playbooks means you have to fill in some blanks as you 
make characters. If your Nova is a sorceress, then you need to speak to the role 
of sorcery in Halcyon City; if they’re a mutant, then you have to answer some 
questions about how mutants fit in. 

That’s all good! The rules ensure that your characters work, that you can 
tell dramatic stories about them. And the basics on Halcyon City (page 9) 
should give you enough of a framework to start answering these questions. But 
after that, it’s down to you. You make your own particular version of Halcyon 
City by filling in the specifics and details as you go. And because  MASKS and 
Halcyon City are about the kind of kaleidoscopic comic book craziness that 
includes nearly anything you can think of, there’s pretty much no way you can 
go wrong, provided everyone in the group thinks the direction you’re taking 
the city is fun.

瑞奇正準備創建他的角色，因此他首先需要挑選他的扮演書。他想扮演比較經典的角色：那些強大、但不會太古怪的英雄角色。他想像的是一名超級強壯、超級堅韌的傢伙，因此他把範圍縮小到了「蠻牛」、「傳承者」、以及「異變者」。再確認一遍後，他發現「異變者」比他預期的還要更怪異一些，而「蠻牛」聽起來又有點太粗魯或不體面，所以他最後決定選擇了「傳承者」。他特別中意做為「經典英雄傳承中的最新成員」的這個概念，而這也正是「傳承者」扮演書的核心議題。
{{< /hint >}}


## 名稱和外貌
You’ve got your playbook! Next you pick your name and your look. These give you a starting point for thinking about your character.

You need to pick your hero name, and you might have to or want to pick your real name, if it’s different from your hero name. For some characters, the two might be the same—if you’re a modern incarnation of the Greek god Athena, and you’re never really an ordinary person, there’s no need to choose a different “real name.” Other characters, though, have a clear dividing line between their costumed heroic identity and their real identity—you might play a regular kid named Maria Moreno, who puts on a costume to become Darkwolf. 

There are examples of real names and possible superhero-style names on the GM sheets, but ultimately it’s your choice—in superhero stories, the best names are the ones you find the most compelling. 

Think about your look, how you physically appear to others—how you present yourself, what you regularly wear, and so on. Choose as many from each list as apply. You might also choose some options differentiating how you look in your heroic persona and how you look the rest of the time.

{{< hint info >}}
瑞奇接下來要決定他「傳承者」角色的名稱和外貌。他決定他的角色是個男性，中東人（伊朗裔）。他想像的是一個英俊的年輕人，生於美國，但有著伊朗血統。接下來他挑選了「潮流的服裝」；他認為他的角色在以市民身分行動時會打扮得相當得體。接著，「前任的英雄服」──他角色穿著與前輩英雄相同的基本英雄服，因此這件英雄服會是某種標誌性，相對經典，使用大膽配色和線條的服裝，大概會是彈性纖維織品。在瑞奇的腦海中，這件衣服是以紅色與白色為基底。

最後，他需要為角色挑選名稱。在簡單的查詢研究後，他決定挑選「魯斯塔姆．阿塔爾」做為他角色的真名。至於他的英雄名則取作「神雀 (Huma)」，典故為伊朗神話的不死鳥。
{{< /hint >}}


## 超能力
Now pick your abilities. Abilities is a broad term, meant to indicate the special 
things your character can do that puts them into the superheroic world. Some 
abilities are the height of standard human capabilities—Olympic-level athletics, 
for  instance.  Others  are  straight  up  incredible  superhuman  abilities,  like 
controlling fire or reading minds. Choose as many abilities as your playbooks 
says  from  the  available  list.  Some  playbooks  have  special  instructions  for 
abilities, such as the Bull or the Protégé. Simply follow those instructions.

Your abilities leave some information up to interpretation. A Nova might 
have sorcery, but that doesn’t tell you exactly what sorcery looks like, how it 
works, or what you can do with it. An Outsider might have radical shapeshifting, 
but that doesn’t say exactly how they change shape, or what they can change 
shape into—just that it’s radical, probably changing their whole body into totally 
different shapes, not just changing their face. In two different games, a player 
could create a Legacy with the same exact abilities as in the other game—super 
strength, invincibility, and flight—but they can look completely different, with 
one of them being simply an invulnerable and god-like humanoid, and the 
other wearing a powerful suit of protective mechanized armor. 

Abilities don’t clearly state exactly what you can or can’t do: after all, if your 
ability is super speed, that doesn’t tell you at all whether you can travel at 600 
miles per hour, or break the sound barrier, or vibrate your molecules through 
a wall. Abilities give you a clearer picture of your character at the start of play 
and a jumping off point for figuring out what makes sense for your character’s 
specific capabilities. For example, someone whose abilities are martial arts and 
swords probably can’t run at 600 miles per hour, break the sound barrier, or 
vibrate their molecules through a wall. Yet.

You’ll discover the specifics of your abilities through play at your table, 
through discussions with the GM, and through your own decisions. After all, 
you’re playing to find out!

{{< hint info >}}
神雀 是「傳承者」，所以他決定超能力的方式跟其他扮演書會稍微有些不同。在決定神雀的超能力時，瑞奇得先從扮演書的超能力列表中挑選其中一組，再從中劃掉兩個他尚未掌握的能力。他首先挑選了最經典的那組超能力：超級力量、刀槍不入、眼睛雷射、飛行、超級感官。接著他從中劃掉了眼睛雷射跟超級感官。這代表神雀現在擁有超級力量、刀槍不入、和飛行的能力。

瑞奇在考慮是否要讓這些超能力透過某種驚人的型態展現──也許他會在飛行時長出真正的翅膀、或也許當他發揮超級力量時會冒出烈焰──但最終他還是採用了相當經典的表現方式：他無比驚人的強壯，他的身體堅不可摧，而且他能夠在空中翱翔，在身後留下一道黃金色的軌跡。經典！

### BUT WHAT ABOUT THAT ONE POWER?
You may notice that not every possible power is represented, especially not for 
every playbook. You may wish that a particular power was listed, or that it was 
left open-ended so you could fill in whatever power you want.

Here’s the thing. I guarantee that the abilities listed for each playbook will 
work well in play. They’ll give you exactly the kind of springboard you need 
to make interesting characters, while still giving you an idea of what your 
character can do, and ultimately playing into the particular issues and themes 
of each playbook. 

Within those abilities, there’s still plenty of wiggle room to define them how 
you want. The Bull, for example, is superhumanly tough, incredibly strong, and 
uniquely skilled at fighting. That could mean that the Bull can turn to metal at 
will, or it could mean that the Bull has a ridiculous healing factor, or it could 
mean that the Bull can grow to enormous size—any of those descriptions fits 
the general categories of “tough, strong, and skilled at fighting.” Take advantage 
of that wiggle room to make your abilities what you want them to be.

After that, if you still don’t want to pick one of the listed abilities, or you’d 
rather pick something else you’ve come up with—you can do that! I won’t be 
at your table ready to swat you with a ruler if you don’t play exactly according 
to the playbook as written. But…I can’t guarantee other abilities will work as 
well—some abilities might even outright contradict the point of some of the 
playbooks. For example, playing a Bull with an open-ended and incredibly 
useful power like telekinesis could change what the Bull is about, making 
them more like a Nova than a Bull. Playing a Beacon with real, useful, genuine 
superpowers totally undermines the point of that playbook, and playing an 
Outsider without strange or particularly alien powers takes away some of the 
dramatic oomph of that playbook. 

So  if  you  want  to  use  other  abilities  than  those  listed,  go  ahead—it’s 
ultimately your game and your table. It still might work just fine, and you still 
might have a great time. But using the abilities listed in the playbooks is your 
best bet to make MASKS work for you.


## 標籤屬性
In MASKS, you have five main stats called Labels. Each Label tells you how your 
character understands their self-image. These Labels shift and change over the 
course of play as your character’s own self-image changes, and those changes 
are often in direct reaction to how others see you. When you’re a young hero, 
how you see yourself is determined just as much by others as it is by your own 
choices, for better or worse.

The five Labels are:

Danger:  seeing yourself as threatening, strong, bloody-knuckled, and risky. 
Other people see you as a danger when they think they should steer clear of 
you because you might bring them harm. You see yourself as a danger when 
you believe you can take down other dangerous threats, and when you think 
you yourself are a threat to other people.

Freak:  seeing yourself as strange, unusual, unique, and powerful. Other 
people see you as a freak when they think you’re odd, unlike them, something 
unnatural or outside of their understanding. You see yourself as a freak when 
you accept and own the things you can do that no one else can, and when you 
think you don’t belong with the people and the world around you.

Savior:  seeing yourself as defending, guarding, protecting, and stalwart. 
Other people see you as a savior when they think of you as noble or self-
sacrificing, or a bit overbearing and moralizing. You see yourself as a savior 
when you think of yourself as a martyr, someone who gladly sacrifices to 
protect and defend others.

Superior:  seeing yourself as smart, capable, crafty, and quick. Other people 
see you as superior when they think you’re the smartest person in the room, 
an arrogant and egotistical jerk. You see yourself as superior when you think 
you’re cleverer than everyone else, and when you know exactly what to say to 
make the people around you do what you want.

Mundane:   seeing  yourself  as  normal,  human,  empathetic,  and 
understanding. Other people see you as mundane when they think of you as 
all too normal and uninteresting, but also comprehending and sympathetic. 
You see yourself as mundane when you think you’re regular, just a person, 
not special, and focused on normal human things like feelings and emotions.

### RULES FOR LABELS
Every playbook comes with a predetermined set of values for your Labels. You 
can add +1 to any one Label of your choice, making sure it doesn’t go over 
+3. You might want to look at the basic moves and your playbook moves to 
determine what Label you want to add +1 to, but you can also do it just based 
on your character’s self-image.

On your playbook, record your starting Labels by circling the appropriate 
numbers on each line. Do this in pencil; your Labels will change a lot!

A couple important rules for your Labels: 

* The vast majority of the time, when one Label shifts up, another shifts down, and vice versa. There might be a few cases when this isn’t true, but if rules reference shifting Labels without further explanation, this is what they mean: one goes up, and another goes down.

* If a Label would shift up past +3, or down past -2, then no shift at all occurs—neither of the two Labels that would change goes up or down. Instead, you mark a condition—a negative emotional state that starts affecting your actions. If you see yourself as too much of an extreme, hen it starts messing you up.

{{< hint info >}}
按照傳承者的扮演書，神雀的起始標籤數性為 古怪+0, 危險-1, 救助+2, 優越+0, 和 平凡+1。因此在遊戲開始時，神雀對自我的最主要認知會是一名善於救助他人的人，有些自認平凡，且並不是個會危害他人的威脅。瑞奇決定將他的自由配點加到優越上；他認為神雀相當聰明，並也許會因此有些驕傲自大。
{{< /hint >}}



## 狀態
You don’t have any decisions to make here, but understanding conditions 
might affect your choices on some of your moves. All PCs have the same five 
conditions to mark: Afraid, Angry, Guilty, Hopeless, and Insecure. Sometimes 
you have to mark conditions during the game as a result of moves and misses. 
While you have a condition marked, you take -2 ongoing to particular basic 
moves, depending on which condition it is. If you have multiple conditions 
marked, all are applicable. There are a few ways to clear conditions, and you 
can find out more about them on page 88.


## 背景故事
Each set of backstory questions is a series of prompts to get you thinking 
about  your  character’s  identity,  how  they  relate  to  Halcyon  City  and  its 
superhuman side, and how they relate to other people. Try to jot down a 
few answers to these questions so you can bring them up during character 
introductions. When other characters are brought up in these questions, focus 
on NPCs and avoid using other PCs to answer the questions.

For  the  moment,  skip  the  “When  Our  Team  First  Came  Together,” “Relationships” and “Influence” sections.

{{< hint info >}}
瑞奇寫下了幾個關於神雀背景故事的答案：
- **「你是何時正式成為你家族傳承中的一員？」**<br/>
在我的16歲生日，父親喚醒了我體內的力量，並給了我神雀的這個名號。

- **「你家族傳承中最偉大的成就是什麼？」**<br/>
即使黑渦利用中子星物質在他胸口製造出了可怕的黑洞，神雀仍然單槍匹馬將他徹底擊敗。

- **「大眾是如何看待你們的家族傳承？」**<br/>
相當正面。神雀是個傳統且高貴的英雄，在整個家族搬遷過來時被神翠市給接納。

- **「你的家族傳承跟你成為英雄的理由有什麼關係？」**<br/>
這幾乎就是我成為英雄的所有原因。我從來沒打算要從事其他存在，也從來沒想過這個問題。

- **「你為什麼在乎這個團隊？」**<br/>
因為神雀的全部就是成為重人的表率，而我可以成為他們的好榜樣。

## 挑選扮演書動作
At  the  start  of  play, any character can trigger  the  basic  moves,  including 
directly engage a threat,  unleash your powers,  defend someone,  assess 
the situation, provoke someone, comfort or support someone, and pierce 
someone’s mask. Each of these moves triggers when the characters take action 
in the fiction that match the move.

In  addition  to  the  basic  moves,  every  character  gets  some  playbook 
moves that may grant them wholly new abilities or may build on the basic 
moves. Some of them require their own rolls, while others change the way the 
basic moves work or add new abilities that work without a roll.

Each playbook has its own rules for how many and which playbook moves 
you can take at the start of play. Follow those rules. If you want to change 
where you put the +1 in your Labels to match up with playbook moves you 
like, go right ahead—you haven’t started playing yet. But keep in mind your 
Labels will change, so any such connection is liable to be temporary. 

Many of the playbooks also have extras. These aren’t moves; while they 
may follow the move structure, they’re special additional pieces that define the 
different playbooks and make them more distinct and interesting. For example, 
the Doomed playbook has their doom track and doomsigns, and the Janus 
playbook has their mundane life. Make any necessary decisions about your 
extras as you go through your playbook.

Over  the  course  of  play,  you  may  be  able  to  take  moves  from  other 
playbooks. There’s space for you to write those in. Keep in mind that taking 
another playbook move doesn’t mean you can take another playbook’s extra. 
You have to switch playbooks to get access to a Legacy’s lineage or the Nova’s 
flares (with a few exceptions built into the advancement lists).

{{< hint info >}}
瑞奇看著他的扮演書動作區塊，並發現自己可以從中選擇兩個扮演書動作。他選擇了〈過往的建言〉和〈打一場好架〉。他還需要在「家族傳承」區塊的空白欄位中填上至少兩個他家族傳承的成員。他選擇了他的父親：沙辛．阿塔爾 做為已經退休且會出言批評的角色、並選擇了 惡魔魂怪 做為他們家族傳承遭遇過最強大的對手。身為GM，我馬上開始思考要如何把這些NPC帶到故事中！
{{< /hint >}}


## 關鍵時刻
You don’t have any decisions to make about your playbook’s Moment of Truth, 
but it’s good to familiarize yourself with it early. Your Moment of Truth 
is a script for a special instant when you get to seize control of the game’s 
conversation. Each playbook’s is a bit different, and gives you an idea for the 
kinds of thing you’re allowed to say when you trigger your Moment of Truth. 

You’re not mind-controlling anybody, so you probably can’t say what the other 
PCs or NPCs choose to do—but you can say largely everything else, including 
how you defeat them or how you change the world around you. It’s a moment 
when the spotlight’s on your character, and we’re all interested in seeing them 
be awesome—which means you get to say what happens in a much more direct 
fashion than at any other time in the game.

You can’t trigger your Moment of Truth until you’ve unlocked it 
through advancement (page 115). Then, you can trigger it whenever you 
want, and during that scene you have full control of describing 
what your character does, for as long as you remain within 
your playbook’s script. After your Moment of Truth is over, 
you permanently lock one of your Labels—it will never 
change again (page 118). 

Your Moment of Truth tells you a lot about the key, 
critical moment for your playbook—what it looks 
like when everything comes to a head, and your 
character shows off the fullest extent of what 
they can do. 

{{< hint info >}}
瑞奇概略地瀏覽了一下他的「關鍵時刻」：它的內容是關於他完全發揮了他的力量，並需要維護並支撐起他家族傳承的完整重擔。瑞奇因此得到了一個明確的概念．神雀的故事將會著重在這個名號帶來的壓力和負擔上。
{{< /hint >}}


## 團隊動作
Every character gets two team moves, one that triggers when they share a 
triumphant celebration with someone, and one that triggers when they share 
a vulnerability or weakness with someone. You don’t have any decisions to 
make here, but read through the team moves for your playbook to get an idea 
of your playbook’s issues and how they relate to other characters at critical, 
dramatic moments. 

{{< hint info >}}
瑞奇看了看他的兩個團隊動作。「慶祝勝利」動作主要涉及了傳承者如何面對自己的優越感，而「傾訴弱點」動作則涉及了他家族傳承的秘密。瑞奇對此有了些想法，神雀的戲劇弧線將會著重處理他在團隊中的位置──且為了符合他的傾訴弱點動作，他的家族傳承必須要有一個秘密才行。
{{< /hint >}}


## 自我介紹
Once everyone finishes filling out most of their playbooks (everything except 
for their “When Our Team First Came Together” section, their Relationships, 
and their Influence section), then it’s time for character introductions.

One at a time, each player takes a few minutes to share their name, their 
look, their abilities, the answer to their backstory questions, and anything else 
important that the other characters might know about them. During this time, 
the other players and the GM especially can and should ask them questions to 
get a better grasp on who the character is.  

{{< hint info >}}
瑞奇向大家介紹神雀這個角色，說明他的外觀長相、他的超能力、以及一些設定，比如說神雀是傳承了超級英雄「神雀」名號的最新成員，他的父親已經退休，而且他的真實身分並沒有公諸於眾。我，身為GM，接著問了他一些問題以得到更多資訊，像是「英雄『神雀』這個名號已經在神翠市存在活躍了多久的時間？」
{{< /hint >}}

### 「當團隊初次集結時……」
After introductions, determine the inciting incident that made this team of 
young superheroes come together in the first place. It was something big, 
something  that  none  of  them  could  tackle  on  their  own,  something  that 
required them to work together against far greater odds, something that forged 
them into a group greater than the sum of its parts. When you actually start 
playing, you’ll tell a story set some time after this inciting incident—the team’s 
been together for a while at this point. This process just makes sure everybody’s 
on the same page for how it all started.

Each playbook has its own statement and question. One by one, each 
player reads their “When our team first came together…” question out loud, 
so everyone knows what questions are on the table. Then, the GM leads the 
group in a discussion about those questions and their answers, filling in the 
details of what happened when the team first came together.

Each player has total control over the answers to their playbook’s question. 
They can ask for input and ideas from the other playbooks, but they have final 
say. Each succeeding question should build on and take into account what 
came before.

The questions should be answered in a particular order to ensure that the 
answers build on each other and you aren’t trying to figure out the details 
before you’ve covered the fundamentals. The discussion can cover whatever 
ground comes up, but it’s the GM’s job to pointedly ask the players to answer 
their questions in the order provided on the GM sheet.

If a particular playbook isn’t in play, then its question doesn’t need to be 
answered. The GM can still choose to ask the question of the group, in which 
case the answer comes from group consensus or from whatever player the GM 
chooses to ask. 

The group as a whole and the GM in particular should ask additional 
questions as necessary to fill in the details on this incident, until everybody 
has a pretty clear picture of what happened and who was involved. At the end 
of this process, you should have a good idea of the incident that drew the group 
together, their very first adventure, and the roles that the PCs played in it.


{{< hint info >}}
當輪到神雀的初次集結問題時，玩家們已經在回答其他問題的過程中填寫了不少資訊。我們知道了他們曾在市中心與一個強大到荒謬的巨大敵人交手，一個名叫機械暴龍雷克斯的怪物。在奮戰的過程中，他們不小心炸毀了飛行自由女俠的紀念碑。我們也得知他們救下了市長伊芙琳．清水的性命，且為了取得勝利，他們扯開了時間與空間的破口，並將機械暴龍雷克斯給推了進去──而這徹底違反了年長英雄們和A.E.G.I.S所設下的規定。

現在，是時候回答傳承者扮演書上的問題了。瑞奇吸了口氣，大聲朗誦：「從各方面來看，我們算做得不錯，並讓一位著名的英雄印象深刻。他是誰？」

瑪莉莎提議這個英雄可以是新典範聯盟（城市中的頭號超級英雄團隊）的領導者，但傑克馬上指出這會削弱他們因為撕開時空破洞而激怒年長英雄的嚴重性。瑞奇表示同意，取而代之，他提議這位英雄可以是個更沉默一些、更偏好在幕後行事的人物──千面客，一名可以變化成任意樣貌，且從未以相同外貌出現在他人面前的變形者。其他玩家都喜歡這個主意，瑞奇便採用了這個設定。

我問：「那麼，為什麼他對你們印象深刻？」

瑞奇回答：「我們做了必要的舉動，而且我們毫不猶豫，即使這會違反規則也一樣。這正是千面客所認同的特質。」

我點頭，然後我們便接著回答下一個問題。
{{< /hint >}}


## 人際關係
Once you know the details of the incident that brought the team together, 
fill out each character’s relationships with the others. Each playbook has 
two relationships on it, sentences with blanks in them. One at a time, each 
player reads one sentence from their playbook, and fills in the name of a fellow 
teammate. This sets an initial relationship between those two characters. 

{{< hint info >}}
當輪到瑞奇時，他選擇先填寫他的第一個人際關係。

「我想我曾被逮到跟酷牛姐一起做了件打破我家族規定的事情。」他說。

「噢，正點！」我說：「所以，你們做了什麼？」

「我想我的家族應該會立下明確的規則，要求我們對外樹立一個正面良好的形象。你懂得，沒那麼正式，但老爸總是說，無論何時，只要可能有人在注視著你，你就必須表現出最好的那一面。但因為我想給牛姐留下好印象，所以我曾試著用我的超級英雄名號帶她溜進一間夜總會，然後……結果不怎麼好。順帶一提，老爸聽說了這件事，還把我狠狠罵了一頓。」

「完美！那酷牛姐，妳有因此被打動嗎？」

「不完全是？我的意思是，他沒成功讓我們溜進去對吧。不過他這個嘗試確實是挺可愛的。」瑪莉莎說道。

團隊接著處理了些其他人際關係，然後再次輪到瑞奇。

「關於我的第二個人際關係……我想我會選擇信任胡蜂女，並會告訴她一個關於我家族傳承的秘密。我感覺胡蜂女會是個我可以放心交託的對象，如果我不慎失控的話，我能放心讓她負責打倒我。」

「很好！那麼這個秘密是什麼呢？」我問道。

「關於如何奪去我超能力的秘密。有這麼一種羽毛，據說是從真正的神雀身上取下來的，只要你把它們帶在身上，我的超能力就無法影響你。而如果你把它們放到我身上，那麼我的超能力就為徹底消散。」瑞奇說道。在這之前，這一切都還不是事實……但它現在是了！

「太棒了！那你有把這些羽毛給胡蜂女嗎？」

「沒，我只是把羽毛的事告訴她而已。」瑞奇回答。

「那胡蜂女，妳在這之後有進一步對這些羽毛的事情做調查嗎？」

「那是當然的。」喬說道：「我想我知道其中一片羽毛的下落，假如我到時候真的需要它的話：就在博物館。」
{{< /hint >}}

Feel free to discuss these relationships as you go. Ultimately, each player has 
final say over whose name they put into each blank, but they should feel free 
to ask for suggestions or ideas. 


## 影響力
Finally, each character gives out some Influence  to their teammates. Influence 
in MASKS is a binary resource—someone either has it over you, or they don’t. If 
someone has Influence over you, it means you care about what they think, say, 
or do about you. It means their words carry weight with you, and can change 
how you see yourself. By default, in MASKS, all adults hold Influence over the PCs. 
This section of character creation is about sharing Influence among teammates.

Each playbook has a section that describes how much Influence they give 
out to their teammates. Sometimes you have to make a choice about your 
initial demeanor, how you come off to the others first thing—other times it just 
tells you how many characters you give Influence to. Choose which teammates 
you give Influence to, and hand them one of your Influence tokens to mark it. 

You can always choose to give out more Influence—if you think your 
character cares about somebody’s words, then you should give them Influence 
over you if they don’t already have it. But you have to at least give out as much 
as your playbook tells you to. 

When handing out Influence, think about whose words your character 
most cares about at the moment, who’s most likely to be able to change how 
they see their self. Influence comes and goes over the course of play, so don’t 
worry too much about this initial set-up.


{{< hint info >}}
是時候輪到神雀給出影響力了，瑞奇按照傳承者扮演書上的說明：

「無論好壞，你都是這個團隊的一份子，且你在乎他們的想法。讓你的所有隊友獲得對你的影響力。」瑞奇大聲朗誦，接著他把他的影響力代幣發給每一個其他玩家：神雀在乎他們的所有想法。
