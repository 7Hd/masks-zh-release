# HOOKS AND ARCS
When  you  run  MASKS,  you’ll  inevitably  have  an  impulse  to  plan  stories  in 
advance. Maybe you think one of the PCs should choose to leave the team for 
a corporate sponsored team that turns out to be a trap set in motion by the 
Dread Queen, eventually discovering the trap but ultimately overcoming it 
thanks to their new teammates. All that has to happen is for the PC to choose 
to leave the team and fall into the trap, right? And you—as the all-powerful 
Gamemaster—can just make that happen.

Don’t do that. 

You play MASKS to find out what changes. Even the GM doesn’t know exactly 
what will happen. You definitely won’t know what the PCs will do or who their 
characters will choose to be. Any plan you come up with pales in significance 
to what happens if you let the story evolve naturally—and enforcing your plan 
would take away the PCs’ right to make choices in the story. 

Instead of figuring out what will happen, you need to do another kind 
of preparation to run MASKS. You create pairs of hooks—people or fictional 
elements tied to individual PCs, pulling them in different directions—and 
arcs—a connected series of fictional elements that try to change Halcyon City, 
most likely for the worst. 


## HOOKS VS ARCS
Hooks are tools for focusing on the PCs and their stories. They remind you 
of what characters most strongly pull the PCs in different directions, and they 
give you guidance on how to use those characters during play. Hooks come 
in pairs: two characters that put two different Labels in conflict for the PC—
Danger vs Savior, Freak vs Mundane, Superior vs Danger, Savior vs Freak, etc. 
Each character is an individual hook. The two hooks aren’t necessarily directly 
in conflict with each other; the pairing isn’t about those two characters fighting 
each other, but instead about discovering which path the PC will follow.

Arcs, on the other hand, are tools for tracking overarching issues in your 
game of MASKS. Instead of focusing on any individual PC, they give you the 
chance to build on the escalating problems facing the team. When Vanquish’s 
alien invasion fleet is getting closer and closer to Earth, that’s an arc. When the 
Teacher is assembling an army of brainwashed, extradimensionally infected 
children, that’s an arc. Arcs help structure your overall story, and give you a 
way to pace the conflict over multiple sessions.
