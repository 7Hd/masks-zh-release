## CREATING ARCS
The plans of villains and antagonists in Halcyon City are sometimes as simple 
as, “Rob a bank!” “Steal a McGuffin!” But the PCs also have to save the city 
from grander, more dangerous, more dramatic threats, problems that span 
across multiple issues of your comic and multiple sessions of your game. Those 
threats and problems are your arcs. 

Each arc has a cast of NPCs and other fictional elements (places and objects 
of importance), an arc type, and three phases. It represents a combined set of 
threats, dangers, and issues that feed into each other to create a larger set of 
problems facing the PCs. 

Arcs aren’t plots—they’re not lists of things that will definitely happen. 
They’re compilations of what the antagonists and dangers of Halcyon City 
might bring to fruition—how they might change the city. They’re a way for 
you to track what the big, overarching difficulties in the city are, and what you 
should be drawing on for future sessions. 

To build an arc, follow these steps:
* Choose an arc type 
* Build out the cast 
* Fill in the phases 
* Create custom moves (optional) 
* Give it a name and description


### CHOOSE AN ARC TYPE
There are 5 kinds of arc you could make:
* Corruption — something good, positive, or helpful is made dangerous and threatening 
* Invasion — threats and enemies fight their way into control 
* Restriction — those with power place constraints on those without 
* Destruction — threats and enemies break and destroy what stands in their way 
* Restoration — the heroes push to repair what damage has been done 

Each arc type comes with several subtypes to further define exactly what 
the arc is about and to give it an impulse—an overarching tendency for the 
arc, a way to understand where the arc is heading. Arcs also come with their 
own moves, which you can make any time you could make any other kind of 
move, to push an arc further along its particular issues.


#### CORRUPTION 
Corruption  arcs  are  subtle  and  dangerous.  They  undermine  the  good  of 
Halcyon City, turning friends to foes, heroes to villains, hope to fear. 

##### Corruption Subtypes: 
* Falling Hero (impulse: to commit to a rigid code of ethics) 
* Greedy Power (impulse: to wield power selfishly) 
* Stolen Innocence (impulse: to make terrible decisions) 
* Twisted Truth (impulse: to spin lies) 
* Traitorous Ally (impulse: to betray) 

##### Corruption Moves: 
* Pontificate about the true nature of things 
* Present enticing gifts with strings 
* Offer a temporary alliance 
* Twist the narrative publicly 
* Make threats, subtle or not 

Corruption arcs almost always involve at least some cast members acting 
as the corruptors and some acting as the corrupted. The transition is never 
immediate—the PCs get to see the change. 



#### INVASION 
Invasion arcs are about dangerous forces seizing useful or desirable resources 
for themselves. Invaders are hoping to take control of something by force, not 
aiming to destroy it. You can’t control something that’s destroyed. 

##### Invasion Subtypes: 
* Aliens (impulse: to subvert or eliminate those in power) 
* Criminals (impulse: to seize territory at any cost) 
* Outsiders (impulse: to subvert or eliminate those without power) 
* Time travelers (impulse: to control the actions of predecessors) 
* Spies (impulse: to take control of valuable resources) 

##### Invasion Moves: 
* Pour forth a horde of soldiers 
* Directly assault a stronghold
* Secretly infiltrate a stronghold 
* Demand submission 
* Capture innocents 

Invasion arcs can be subtle or direct, depending on the situation and the 
invaders. Sometimes, aliens pour from a portal over the city...other times, they 
shapeshift and secretly infiltrate important agencies. 



#### RESTRICTION 
Restriction arcs are about powers exerting their might to lock down the heroes 
and others in the city. Restriction arcs tighten around the PCs, trapping them 
into rules and situations in which they’re supposed to be unable to take action. 

##### Restriction Subtypes: 
* Law (impulse: to outlaw and restrict) 
* Military (impulse: to crack down on rampant elements) 
* Agents (impulse: to control how others use power) 
* Heroes (impulse: to uphold tradition) 
* Corporations (impulse: to protect their interests from any threat) 

##### Restriction Moves: 
* Deploy surprising strength and force 
* Offer a warning 
* Interfere in heroic situations 
* Create new rules and restrictions 
* Reward obedience 

The casts of restriction arcs are the faces of forces much larger than the 
PCs, be they superhero teams, corporations, or law enforcement agencies. Play 
up the inexperience and youth of the PCs during a restriction arc—this is the 
quintessential “parents laying down a new curfew” arc, but at a superheroic 
level.



#### DESTRUCTION 
Destruction arcs are about breaking pieces of the world. They’re always about 
destroying some specific thing, not everything. Everyone at the table knows 
that if Halcyon City explodes then the game would be over. An individual 
villain’s plan may be to destroy the world, sure, but the arc is about destroying 
something specific. 

Notice that the subtypes for a destruction arc refer to the target of the 
destruction—not what is doing the destroying. 

##### Destruction Subtypes: 
* Defenders of the City (impulse: to draw out defenders with danger) 
* Item of Power (impulse: to smash and grab) 
* Prison (impulse: to free the restrained) 
* Authorities of the City (impulse: to break tradition) 
* Dangers to the City (impulse: to hunt and pursue doggedly) 

##### Destruction Moves: 
* Leave a trail of rubble and fires 
* Endanger innocents with collateral damage 
* Break the bindings on a danger 
* Destroy a public landmark 
* Explain the necessity for destruction 

Always tie destruction arcs strongly to the human motivations of the 
villains and antagonists involved. The destruction they seek is always strangely 
justified to them; it’s not a real arc if they’re just doing it for fun. 



#### RESTORATION 
Restoration arcs are about fixing damage, healing wounds, and making the 
world right again. Often they’re about cleaning up the mess of another arc. 
Note that some of these subtypes are callbacks to other types of arcs. If 
someone’s trying to undo the damage done by an arc in the past, they’re likely 
calling on the relevant subtype here. 

##### Restoration Subtypes: 
•  Redemption (impulse: to draw into the light) 
•  Reclamation (impulse: to repel through force and battle) 
•  Rebellion (impulse: to subvert through chaos and mayhem) 
•  Reconstruction (impulse: to rebuild despite danger) 

##### Restoration Moves: 
* Reveal a rebuilt threat 
* Uncover an old secret 
* Rally the people to a cause 
* Destroy the forces in power 
* Share a vision of the future 

The PCs may want to restore things on their own, but always have NPCs 
looking to restore pieces of the world. The methods NPCs choose to fulfill their 
restoration plans will still put them at odds with the PCs.


### BUILD OUT THE CAST
Once you’ve chosen what kind of arc you’re assembling, fill out the cast, a list of 
NPCs involved with that arc. A few of these characters will be obvious. If you’re 
creating a destruction arc, whoever’s doing the destruction has to be a cast 
member. If you’re creating an invasion arc, the lead invader and their forces 
need to be listed under the cast. But flesh out the cast with other characters as 
well, people who aren’t necessarily on board with the overall plan of the arc, 
but who have a vested interest in the situation in some way. 

Focus especially on characters you write up as villains. Remember that 
in this context, “villains” don’t have to be evil (and in fact, shouldn’t be so 
obviously evil). They just have to be antagonistic, clear opponents for the PCs to 
face. Try to have at least three or four of these villain cast members for your arc. 

For each cast member, think about how their drive in general relates to 
how they’d interact with this arc in particular. What would they want out of 
it? Whose side would they be on? What’s their angle? 

And as always, try to reincorporate. If you can use villains or NPCs who’ve 
already shown up in your game, your game will be stronger and more coherent, 
especially if those villains or NPCs are also hooks.


### FILL IN THE PHASES
Arcs are split up into multiple phases, to help you track them as they advance 
and progress through your story. There are three phases to every arc:

* **Setting the board**:  In this phase, the arc is just getting into motion. The 
cast is maneuvering and taking first steps, but nothing has come to a head yet.

* **Making a move**:  In this phase, the arc is in swing. The cast is making moves, 
pushing towards their goals, and the issues of the arc are coming to fruition.

* **Endgame**:  In this phase, the arc is hitting the end. The cast is making their 
final moves, and the issues of the arc are in do-or-die territory. 

For each phase of your arc, jot down the plans and intents of the different 
cast members. Start with any cast members directly supporting the overall 
nature of the arc, and then move to the cast members either opposing the arc or 
acting in its periphery. Phrase all their plans as statements of what they’re going 
to do, each one beginning with a verb: “Steal the Quantum Splicer,” “Collect 
evidence on superheroic mistakes,” “Find a weakness in the Spike’s defenses.” 

Escalate the plans across the different phases. Make them raise the stakes 
and build on prior plans. If an NPC’s plan in the first phase is “Collect the 
pieces for the Infinite Portal,” then in the second phase, push their plan forward 
a step: “Open up the Infinite Portal.” And in the third phase, push their plan 
forward into its final step: “Summon the hordes of Deathdream through the 
Infinite Portal.” If you can, create plans that can function independently across 
the different phases. But in general, it’s most important that the plans escalate 
the sense of danger and potential disaster. 

As long as you have three or four plans recorded for your cast, you’re good 
for each phase. If you have more cast members, you don’t need to come up with 
a plan for each and every one. 

These plans tell you what the characters involved with the arc will do 
throughout the game. They let you think between panels ( page 133), and 
make moves accordingly. When you’re looking for another way to stir the pot, 
look to these plans. Have your NPCs pursue their plans, making moves and 
stirring up trouble. When two of your NPCs have resolved their plans for the 
current phase, either failing at them entirely or succeeding, move onto the next 
phase and start making moves from those plans.

You can always come in and adjust your NPCs’ plans if necessary. Don’t feel 
beholden to them if the situation changes substantially—your NPCs would 
react and adjust their intents.


### CREATE CUSTOM MOVES
If you want to further develop an arc, make some custom moves for it. These 
moves are still always aimed at the players (not you). You’re giving the PCs more 
ways to interact with the arc and its issues when you create a custom move.

For more on making custom moves, see CUSTOM MOVES (page 197). 



### GIVE IT A NAME AND DESCRIPTION
Finally, give your arc a name: something evocative and descriptive, that you’d 
see at the front of the comic book issues to flag they’re all part of the same story-
line. Make it fun, something that’ll remind you what the arc is actually about: 
“The Starborn Invasion” or “The Spider’s Web” or “The Doom from Within.”

Then, write a few sentences of description, tying the arc together and 
making the stakes clear. Since you’re the only one looking at your arcs, you 
don’t have to worry about making them crystal clear, so long as you have 
enough that you can use them at your table and know what they’re about.

## HOW TO USE ARCS
Your arcs provide you with a framework to help guide what moves you make 
and what actions your NPCs take. When you’re at a loss, look down at your 
arcs for some guidance. You can always make arc moves when appropriate, 
and you can frame scenes around the PCs encountering and dealing with the 
plans of the arc’s cast.

Keep track of when the plans of the cast members are resolved during the 
arc, too. Remember that once two such plans are resolved for any single phase 
of the arc, you should move to the next phase. Use the current phase of the 
arc to help determine how hard you should be making your moves. As you 
advance phases, the tension should increase, and your moves should get harder.

When two plans of the third phase of your current arc have been resolved, 
then the whole arc should resolve. Reassess the current state of the city, and 
between sessions, build a new arc.

## SAMPLE ARC

**Name**:  The Future Perfect

**Type**:  Invasion (time travelers)

**Impulse**:  To control the actions of predecessors


#### CAST: 
* Future  versions  of  Grasshopper,  Huma,  Toro,  and  Dusk,  known respectively as Antlion, Huma, Crush, and Penumbra
* Ilijah Intrepid, interdimensional traveler trapped in Halcyon City and looking for a means to escape
* Doctor Infinity, time traveling android trying to keep the whole length and breadth of time safe from causal wounds
* Dominus, time traveling apotheosis of metahumanity, seeking to ensure their own creation by controlling the past

#### DESCRIPTION: 
Antlion, Huma, Crush, and Penumbra travel back in time from the future to 
ensure that this pivotal series of events go exactly as they remember. The adults, 
collectively calling themselves “The Hammer,” aim to force the young heroes to 
destroy dangerous villains forthright, ensuring that their younger selves come 
to understand how important direct, overwhelming action is. Doctor Infinity 
reacts to the incursion by attempting to destroy the young heroes herself, to 
ensure their future selves will never time travel, while Dominus sees them as 
threatening the entire potential of his future, and Ilijah Intrepid sees them as 
a potential ticket home.

#### PHASES: 
**Phase one — Setting the board:**
* The  Hammer:  find  and  confront  their  younger  selves,  testing  their abilities to assess the situation
* Doctor Infinity: unleash a weaker, generally insignificant, villain on the team to uncover their current weaknesses in this timestream
* Ilijah  Intrepid:  make  contact  with  the  Hammer  and  offer  them  his assistance in exchange for help getting home
* Dominus: offer information to the young heroes to sway them against their older selves

**Phase two — Making a move:**
* The  Hammer:  push  the  young  heroes  to  destroy  an  enemy—any  of Doctor Infinity, Ilijah Intrepid, or Dominus
* Doctor Infinity: directly strike against the young team members 
* Ilijah Intrepid: earn passage out of Halcyon City by pushing the young heroes to ridiculous lengths with terrible traps
* Dominus: build a temporal stabilizer and prevent all time travel, thereby stopping the Hammer and protecting their timeline

**Phase three — Endgame:**
* The Hammer: put their younger selves’ loved ones in danger to force the young heroes to destroy an enemy
* Doctor Infinity: destroy all of Halcyon City to destroy the young team members
* Ilijah Intrepid: steal the time and dimension traveling technology of the Hammer at any cost
* Dominus: confront the Hammer in a massive battle and destroy them

#### CUSTOM MOVES:
When you pierce the mask of your older self, roll + the Label they now 
embody instead of Mundane.
When you reject the Influence  of your older self, always take +1.
