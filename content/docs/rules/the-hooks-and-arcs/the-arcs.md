## 創造故事弧
有時候，神翠市裡反派和惡棍的計畫只會是簡單的「搶銀行！」或「偷走那個麥高芬！」，但PC們也會需要從更宏大、更危險、更有戲劇性的威脅中拯救這座城市，解決那些橫跨好幾個議題和遊戲聚會的難題。這些威脅和難題，就是你的故事弧。

每個故事弧都會有各自的出演陣容和其他敘事元素（重要的地點和物品）、一種故事弧類型、和三個階段。
它代表了一系列彼此交織的威脅、危險、和議題，創造出一系列更大的難題讓PC們去面對。

故事弧並不是劇本──它們並不是一定會發生的事件清單。它們是行為後果的彙整，神翠市的反派和威脅可能會帶來什麼──會如何改變這座城市。
它們是一種工具，幫助你能追蹤釐清城市中最大、最首要的問題是什麼、以及你在未來的聚會中該取用什麼。


遵循下列步驟來創造故事弧：
* 選擇一個故事弧類型
* 組建出演陣容
* 填寫階段
* 編寫自訂動作（可選）
* 給它一個名稱和描述

---

### 選擇故事弧類型
你總共有五種故事弧類型可以選擇：
* 墮落 — 某個良善、正面、或有幫助的事物被變得危險且有威脅性。
* 侵略 — 敵人和威脅透過戰鬥來取得控制權。
* 限制 — 那些有權力的人們對沒有權力的人們施加了限制。
* 毀滅 — 敵人和威脅破壞並摧毀擋在他們路上的一切。
* 復興 — 英雄們努力修復已經造成的傷害。

每一個故事弧類型底下都還有數個不同的子類別，進一步確切定義這個故事弧的內容，並給予它一個「推動力」──所謂的推動力代表著這個故事弧的整體趨勢，同時也是用來幫助你理解這個故事弧走向的工具。故事弧也帶有自己的動作，你可以在任何你能進行動作的時候使用它們，藉此推動這個故事弧進一步往它特定的主題發展。

<div class='Move'>
<h3>腐墮</h3>
腐墮類型的故事弧危險而難以察覺。它們會破壞神翠市的良善，將朋友轉變成敵人、英雄變成反派、希望變為絕望。

##### 腐墮的子類別: 
* 墮落英雄 (推動力: 恪守嚴格的道德準則) 
* 貪婪權力 (推動力: 自私地行使權力) 
* 被偷走的純真 (推動力: 做出糟糕的決定) 
* 被扭曲的真相 (推動力: 編造謊言) 
* 背叛的盟友 (推動力: 背叛) 

##### 腐墮動作: 
* 自以為是地談論關於事物的本質
* 拋出帶有附加條件的誘人禮物
* 提供暫時性的同盟
* 公開歪曲事實
* 造成威脅，無論隱密與否

腐墮故事弧的出演陣容幾乎總是會涉及幾個作為腐化者的角色、以及幾個擔任墮落者的角色。
這個轉變永遠不會是立即發生的──PC能夠看到變化的過程。
</div><div class='Move'>
<h3>侵略</h3>
侵略類型的故事弧是關於危險的勢力奪取有用或誘人的資源為自己所用。侵略者的目的是利用力量控制某物，而不是摧毀它。
畢竟你可沒辦法控制已經被破壞掉的事物。

##### 侵略的子類別: 
* 外星人 (推動力: 顛覆或消滅那些擁有力量的) 
* 罪犯 (推動力: 不計代價奪取領土) 
* 外來者 (推動力: 顛覆或消滅那些沒有力量的) 
* 時間旅行者 (推動力: 控制前人的行為) 
* 密探 (推動力: 掌控有價值的資源) 

##### 侵略動作: 
* 湧帶出一群群的士兵
* 直接襲擊一個據點
* 秘密滲透一個據點
* 要求投降屈服
* 擄走無辜者

侵略故事弧的發展可以是隱密且難以察覺的、也可以是明顯而直接的，取決於侵略者和情境而定。
有時候，外星人軍隊會從城市上空的傳送門大舉湧入……而又有些時候，它們會改變身形，悄悄地滲透進那些重要的機構。

<h3>限制 RESTRICTION </h3>
Restriction arcs are about powers exerting their might to lock down the heroes 
and others in the city. Restriction arcs tighten around the PCs, trapping them 
into rules and situations in which they’re supposed to be unable to take action. 

##### Restriction Subtypes: 
* Law (impulse: to outlaw and restrict) 
* Military (impulse: to crack down on rampant elements) 
* Agents (impulse: to control how others use power) 
* Heroes (impulse: to uphold tradition) 
* Corporations (impulse: to protect their interests from any threat) 

##### Restriction Moves: 
* Deploy surprising strength and force 
* Offer a warning 
* Interfere in heroic situations 
* Create new rules and restrictions 
* Reward obedience 

The casts of restriction arcs are the faces of forces much larger than the 
PCs, be they superhero teams, corporations, or law enforcement agencies. Play 
up the inexperience and youth of the PCs during a restriction arc—this is the 
quintessential “parents laying down a new curfew” arc, but at a superheroic 
level.
</div><div class='Move'>
<h3>毀滅 DESTRUCTION </h3>
Destruction arcs are about breaking pieces of the world. They’re always about 
destroying some specific thing, not everything. Everyone at the table knows 
that if Halcyon City explodes then the game would be over. An individual 
villain’s plan may be to destroy the world, sure, but the arc is about destroying 
something specific. 

Notice that the subtypes for a destruction arc refer to the target of the 
destruction—not what is doing the destroying. 

##### Destruction Subtypes: 
* Defenders of the City (impulse: to draw out defenders with danger) 
* Item of Power (impulse: to smash and grab) 
* Prison (impulse: to free the restrained) 
* Authorities of the City (impulse: to break tradition) 
* Dangers to the City (impulse: to hunt and pursue doggedly) 

##### Destruction Moves: 
* Leave a trail of rubble and fires 
* Endanger innocents with collateral damage 
* Break the bindings on a danger 
* Destroy a public landmark 
* Explain the necessity for destruction 

Always tie destruction arcs strongly to the human motivations of the 
villains and antagonists involved. The destruction they seek is always strangely 
justified to them; it’s not a real arc if they’re just doing it for fun. 
</div><div class='Move'>
<h3>復興 RESTORATION </h3>
Restoration arcs are about fixing damage, healing wounds, and making the 
world right again. Often they’re about cleaning up the mess of another arc. 
Note that some of these subtypes are callbacks to other types of arcs. If 
someone’s trying to undo the damage done by an arc in the past, they’re likely 
calling on the relevant subtype here. 

##### Restoration Subtypes: 
* Redemption (impulse: to draw into the light) 
* Reclamation (impulse: to repel through force and battle) 
* Rebellion (impulse: to subvert through chaos and mayhem) 
* Reconstruction (impulse: to rebuild despite danger) 

##### Restoration Moves: 
* Reveal a rebuilt threat 
* Uncover an old secret 
* Rally the people to a cause 
* Destroy the forces in power 
* Share a vision of the future 

The PCs may want to restore things on their own, but always have NPCs 
looking to restore pieces of the world. The methods NPCs choose to fulfill their 
restoration plans will still put them at odds with the PCs.

### 組建出演陣容
Once you’ve chosen what kind of arc you’re assembling, fill out the cast, a list of 
NPCs involved with that arc. A few of these characters will be obvious. If you’re 
creating a destruction arc, whoever’s doing the destruction has to be a cast 
member. If you’re creating an invasion arc, the lead invader and their forces 
need to be listed under the cast. But flesh out the cast with other characters as 
well, people who aren’t necessarily on board with the overall plan of the arc, 
but who have a vested interest in the situation in some way. 

Focus especially on characters you write up as villains. Remember that 
in this context, “villains” don’t have to be evil (and in fact, shouldn’t be so 
obviously evil). They just have to be antagonistic, clear opponents for the PCs to 
face. Try to have at least three or four of these villain cast members for your arc. 

For each cast member, think about how their drive in general relates to 
how they’d interact with this arc in particular. What would they want out of 
it? Whose side would they be on? What’s their angle? 

And as always, try to reincorporate. If you can use villains or NPCs who’ve 
already shown up in your game, your game will be stronger and more coherent, 
especially if those villains or NPCs are also hooks.


### 填寫階段
Arcs are split up into multiple phases, to help you track them as they advance 
and progress through your story. There are three phases to every arc:

* **布置棋盤**:  In this phase, the arc is just getting into motion. The 
cast is maneuvering and taking first steps, but nothing has come to a head yet.

* **動手著棋**:  In this phase, the arc is in swing. The cast is making moves, 
pushing towards their goals, and the issues of the arc are coming to fruition.

* **收官**:  In this phase, the arc is hitting the end. The cast is making their 
final moves, and the issues of the arc are in do-or-die territory. 

For each phase of your arc, jot down the plans and intents of the different 
cast members. Start with any cast members directly supporting the overall 
nature of the arc, and then move to the cast members either opposing the arc or 
acting in its periphery. Phrase all their plans as statements of what they’re going 
to do, each one beginning with a verb: “Steal the Quantum Splicer,” “Collect 
evidence on superheroic mistakes,” “Find a weakness in the Spike’s defenses.” 

Escalate the plans across the different phases. Make them raise the stakes 
and build on prior plans. If an NPC’s plan in the first phase is “Collect the 
pieces for the Infinite Portal,” then in the second phase, push their plan forward 
a step: “Open up the Infinite Portal.” And in the third phase, push their plan 
forward into its final step: “Summon the hordes of Deathdream through the 
Infinite Portal.” If you can, create plans that can function independently across 
the different phases. But in general, it’s most important that the plans escalate 
the sense of danger and potential disaster. 

As long as you have three or four plans recorded for your cast, you’re good 
for each phase. If you have more cast members, you don’t need to come up with 
a plan for each and every one. 

These plans tell you what the characters involved with the arc will do 
throughout the game. They let you think between panels ( page 133), and 
make moves accordingly. When you’re looking for another way to stir the pot, 
look to these plans. Have your NPCs pursue their plans, making moves and 
stirring up trouble. When two of your NPCs have resolved their plans for the 
current phase, either failing at them entirely or succeeding, move onto the next 
phase and start making moves from those plans.

You can always come in and adjust your NPCs’ plans if necessary. Don’t feel 
beholden to them if the situation changes substantially—your NPCs would 
react and adjust their intents.


### 編寫自訂動作
If you want to further develop an arc, make some custom moves for it. These 
moves are still always aimed at the players (not you). You’re giving the PCs more 
ways to interact with the arc and its issues when you create a custom move.

For more on making custom moves, see CUSTOM MOVES (page 197). 



### 給它一個名稱和描述
Finally, give your arc a name: something evocative and descriptive, that you’d 
see at the front of the comic book issues to flag they’re all part of the same story-
line. Make it fun, something that’ll remind you what the arc is actually about: 
“The Starborn Invasion” or “The Spider’s Web” or “The Doom from Within.”

Then, write a few sentences of description, tying the arc together and 
making the stakes clear. Since you’re the only one looking at your arcs, you 
don’t have to worry about making them crystal clear, so long as you have 
enough that you can use them at your table and know what they’re about.

## 如何使用故事弧
Your arcs provide you with a framework to help guide what moves you make 
and what actions your NPCs take. When you’re at a loss, look down at your 
arcs for some guidance. You can always make arc moves when appropriate, 
and you can frame scenes around the PCs encountering and dealing with the 
plans of the arc’s cast.

Keep track of when the plans of the cast members are resolved during the 
arc, too. Remember that once two such plans are resolved for any single phase 
of the arc, you should move to the next phase. Use the current phase of the 
arc to help determine how hard you should be making your moves. As you 
advance phases, the tension should increase, and your moves should get harder.

When two plans of the third phase of your current arc have been resolved, 
then the whole arc should resolve. Reassess the current state of the city, and 
between sessions, build a new arc.

## 範例故事弧

**名稱**: 未來的完美典範

**類型**: 侵略 (時間旅行者)

**推動力**: 控制前人的行為


#### 出演陣容: 
* Future  versions  of  Grasshopper,  Huma,  Toro,  and  Dusk,  known respectively as Antlion, Huma, Crush, and Penumbra
* Ilijah Intrepid, interdimensional traveler trapped in Halcyon City and looking for a means to escape
* Doctor Infinity, time traveling android trying to keep the whole length and breadth of time safe from causal wounds
* Dominus, time traveling apotheosis of metahumanity, seeking to ensure their own creation by controlling the past

#### DESCRIPTION: 
Antlion, Huma, Crush, and Penumbra travel back in time from the future to 
ensure that this pivotal series of events go exactly as they remember. The adults, 
collectively calling themselves “The Hammer,” aim to force the young heroes to 
destroy dangerous villains forthright, ensuring that their younger selves come 
to understand how important direct, overwhelming action is. Doctor Infinity 
reacts to the incursion by attempting to destroy the young heroes herself, to 
ensure their future selves will never time travel, while Dominus sees them as 
threatening the entire potential of his future, and Ilijah Intrepid sees them as 
a potential ticket home.

* Dominus: build a temporal stabilizer and prevent all time travel, thereby stopping the Hammer and protecting their timeline

**階段三：收官:**
* The Hammer: put their younger selves’ loved ones in danger to force the young heroes to destroy an enemy
* Doctor Infinity: destroy all of Halcyon City to destroy the young team members
* Ilijah Intrepid: steal the time and dimension traveling technology of the Hammer at any cost
* Dominus: confront the Hammer in a massive battle and destroy them
