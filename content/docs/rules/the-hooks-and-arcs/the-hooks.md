## BUILDING HOOKS
Each hook is an actual character that pulls a PC towards a Label. Pairs of hooks 
are always focused on one PC, in particular on the two Labels by which they 
might be defined. The simplest way to come up with a pair of hooks for a PC 
is to ask: “Is (PC) a (Label) or (Label)?” 

Think of this question as if you’re a reader of your game’s comic book 
series. Where do you think the main characters are going? How do you think 
others see them? What do you think is pushing them to take action? Setting 
up hooks flags these issues and ideas so you can emphasize them during play.

Build some hooks after your first session of play, and always look at them 
between sessions. If you feel that a given pair of hooks has been resolved—
especially if the PC has locked any of the Labels involved in the pair—then 
you should create a new pair of hooks for that PC. In general, hold onto a pair 
of hooks for about three or four sessions before changing up the conflict and 
focusing on a new set of Labels. 

When you build a new pair of hooks:
* Choose the PC that they’re centered on
* Choose the Labels involved
* Assign NPCs to the pairings


### CHOOSING THE PC
Ultimately, you need at least one pair of hooks for each PC so you have 
something to guide you on how to pull each PC’s self-image. When you’re 
choosing which PC to build a new pair of hooks for, though, only choose PCs 
who either don’t have hooks yet or who’ve resolved their last pair of hooks.

When you pick the PC, take a look at their Labels, who has Influence over 
them, whom they have Influence over, and anything else of note about their 
character.


### CHOOSE THE LABELS
Each pair of Labels charts a different kind of conflict, a different set of issues. 
The pairing of Danger vs Savior, for example, is about the tension between 
destructively defeating enemies and saving lives; the pairing of Danger vs 
Freak, on the other hand, is about the fine line between appearing strange and 
powerful, and appearing to be a genuine threat.

Each  Label  in  a  hook  comes  with  an  impulse  that  tells  you  a  general 
direction and drive that hook uses to push the PC toward that Label. For 
example, a Freak hook might feature an impulse of “To isolate and drive 
away,” and a Mundane hook might feature an impulse of “To make normal.” 
When you use those hooks, look for ways to have the Freak hook drive the 
PC into isolation, making them feel different and separate and alone, while 
the Mundane hook offers normalcy, both by making them feel normal and by 
telling them to hide their strangeness and act “normal.”

#### PAIRING: DANGER VS FREAK 

This pairing is about power—especially when it gets out of hand. PCs involved 
in a Danger vs Freak pairing are often the most powerful of their team, capable 
of rewriting existence or causing massive destruction. Those around them 
question whether they can be trusted with their power—maybe because they’re 
kids or because they have more power than anybody should be trusted with.
* Hook Impulse — Danger: To remind them of collateral damage
* Hook Impulse — Freak: To play up their strangeness and capabilities
</div><div class='Move'>

#### PAIRING: DANGER VS MUNDANE
This pairing is about fear. PCs involved in a Danger vs Mundane pairing are 
viewed with understanding by those close to them, and fear by others—until 
things go wrong, and the fear may spread like wildfire. But can they show those 
who fear them that they’re just a person at heart? Or will they turn out to be 
the threat everyone worries can’t be stopped?

•  Hook Impulse — Danger: To mistrust and provoke
•  Hook Impulse — Mundane: To interrupt dangerous situations
</div><div class='Move'>

#### PAIRING: DANGER VS SAVIOR
This pairing is about heroic roles. PCs involved in a Danger vs Savior pairing 
are torn between defeating enemies and saving lives. When they’re caught in a 
dangerous fight, they’re not sure if they should take down the villain fast and 
hard or if they should focus on keeping people safe at the cost of potentially 
letting the villain escape. 

•  Hook Impulse — Danger: To push towards a fight
•  Hook Impulse — Savior: To push away from a straight fight, towards saving lives
</div><div class='Move'>

#### PAIRING: DANGER VS SUPERIOR
This pairing is about control. Superior characters are good at looking around, 
taking in the environment, understanding it, using it...and provoking other 
people to do what they want. Surgical strikes and efforts. Dangerous characters 
are good at punching enemies in the face, at letting loose, at breaking things 
down.  Characters  caught  in  these  arcs  are  stuck  between  precision  and 
uncontrolled venting. 

•  Hook Impulse — Danger: To infuriate and provoke
•  Hook Impulse — Superior: To point out failures of control and planning
</div><div class='Move'>

#### PAIRING: FREAK VS MUNDANE
This pairing is about fitting in, usually focusing on one of two angles: either 
the PC is especially strange, notably different from the people around them, 
and unsure if they’ll ever fit in...or they’re especially normal, and they don’t 
feel different enough. Either way, the people involved in this pairing push them 
either further in sync with the normal people of Halcyon City, or push them 
to be alone, separate from the people around them by their own strangeness.

•  Hook Impulse — Freak: To isolate and drive away
•  Hook Impulse — Mundane: To make normal
</div><div class='Move'>

#### PAIRING: FREAK VS SUPERIOR 
This pairing is about being special. A character who is caught in this pairing 
hears voices on one side telling them they’re better, stronger, and more capable 
than everyone around them, and voices on the other side calling them a 
worthless monster. Either way, they’re struggling to make sense of what their 
difference means.

* Hook Impulse — Freak: To call out the flaws of strangeness
* Hook Impulse  —  Superior:  To  praise  the  power  and  ability  of strangeness
</div><div class='Move'>

#### PAIRING: FREAK VS SAVIOR 
This pairing is about responsibility. What responsibilities does someone with 
intense power have? Are they beholden only to their own power? Or are they 
burdened with the need to make use of their powers for the greater good? 

•  Hook Impulse — Freak: To praise immense power and abilities
•  Hook Impulse — Savior: To place responsibility
</div><div class='Move'>

#### PAIRING: MUNDANE VS SUPERIOR
This pairing is about human connection. Characters with a high Mundane 
can connect with other people on a meaningful level...but they can’t get those 
people to reliably do what they want. Characters with a high Superior, on 
the other hand, can manipulate other people and their environment much 
more directly, but they’re more aloof and detached from those people. With 
this pairing, play up that detachment, the cost of feeling superior and the 
compromises required of being mundane.

•  Hook Impulse — Mundane: To require compromise for connection
•  Hook Impulse — Superior: To detach and distance from others
</div><div class='Move'>

#### PAIRING: MUNDANE VS SAVIOR 
This pairing is about saving others—protecting them from outward and inner 
threats. Saviors are great at stopping a car flying through the air at someone’s 
face, but Mundane characters can actually make people feel better, and might 
even be able to save villains from themselves.

•  Hook Impulse — Mundane: To ask for empathy and mercy
•  Hook  Impulse  —  Savior:  To  demand  defense  and  protection  for 
innocents
</div><div class='Move'>

#### PAIRING: SAVIOR VS SUPERIOR
This pairing is about whether heroes should be proactive or reactive. Saviors 
respond to threats...but superior PCs read the situation and manipulate those 
around them to take action. They solve problems proactively, at the cost of 
being coldly removed from those around them. Which method is truly heroic? 
Fighting the good fight or winning the war?

•  Hook Impulse — Savior: To highlight impending threats
•  Hook Impulse — Superior: To present opportunities for action
</div>

### ASSIGN NPCs
After selecting the pairing for your hooks, assign the 
hooks themselves to either side of the pairing. A hook 
is a fictional element embodying the pull on the PC 
in the direction of a particular Label. It’s the Janus’s 
mother, pulling the Janus to be more and more 
Mundane. It’s the Protégé’s mentor, pulling the 
Protégé to be more and more Superior. 

Hooks should almost always be characters. If 
you feel very strongly that a location or item could 
pull the PC in a particular direction, then use 
it as a hook, but try to stick to characters. 
They can be villains, or they can be friends, or 
family members, or anyone, so long as they’d 
pull the PC in one direction of the pairing. 

Whenever you can, use the same NPCs 
across multiple pairings. That way, you 
instantly generate PC-NPC-PC triangles. 
When the Protégé’s mentor wants 
the Protégé to be more 
of a Savior, but 
continuously 
tells the 
Transformed 
they’re a Danger, there’s 
instant tension, even between those two PCs. 
Reusing the NPCs keeps your game tight and 
focused on that particular set of characters. 

If necessary, you can make up a new 
character to use as a hook for a pairing, but try 
to use characters that are already in your game, even if they’re 
only mentioned on someone’s character sheet when you’re 
filling in your hooks.

## HOW TO USE HOOKS
Set up your hooks between sessions. Doing so makes you think about who 
these characters are, and ask yourself questions about what they might become. 
During play, use your list of hooks as a reference sheet for your moves. 

When you’re at a loss for the next scene, bring the characters together with 
their hooks, and pull them towards the Labels involved. Set scenes using the 
hooks, and push their Labels hard. If you need to make a hard move, have one 
of the hooks take Influence on the PC and shift their Labels.

Use your list of hooks to remind you of the character’s big, primary issue, 
as well. NPCs not even directly involved in the pairing can still poke and push 
and pull at those Labels. When you aren’t sure which Label to shift, think about 
the pairings and the hooks, and try to angle for those Labels.

At the end of every session, ask yourself if it’s still an open question whether 
the PC is one Label or the other. Does the player think it’s resolved? Do you? If 
so, then change that pairing to a new one. If not, then keep that pairing steady, 
and think about other ways to pull on those Labels with those hooks.

## SAMPLE HOOK PAIRING
{{< hint info >}}
I’m brainstorming a pair of hooks for Rex, the Transformed. Rex so far has been 
pretty surly; he’s clearly distraught about his transformed body. He has a high Freak 
and an especially low Mundane...but he also saved Skysong, and he’s been acting 
more like a Savior, especially with her around. I know I can’t make Skysong a hook—
she’s a PC—but I’m thinking about the questions for Rex: maybe “Is he a Freak or a 
Savior?” or “Is he a Danger or a Freak?”

Ultimately, I settle on “Is he a Freak or Mundane?” It fits his Labels as they sit 
right now, and I can more easily think of hooks for the pairing. For Freak, it’s clearly 
Samuel Searley, the television pundit who loves to talk about how terrifying Rex looks. 
I’ll need to tweak what Searley says a bit moving forward to focus more on Freak 
than Danger, but it’s an easy fix. For Mundane, I’m thinking about Grasshopper’s little 
sister, Ciara. Rex met Ciara when he saved her from Carlo the Assassin—and I think 
it’s interesting to have Ciara treat Rex like a normal person. We haven’t seen them 
together on screen yet, but I like reincorporating the same character, and creating a 
PC-NPC-PC triangle with Grasshopper.
