## 創造引鉤
每一個引鉤都代表著一個能把PC拉向某個標籤屬性的角色。 每一對引鉤總是以某個PC為中心，並特別聚焦於這個PC可能被定義的兩個標籤屬性上。
要為PC設計一對引鉤，最簡單的方法就是自問：「（PC）是（標籤屬性）還是（標籤屬性）的？」

把你們的遊戲故事當作一本漫畫，並把自己當作這本漫畫的讀者來回答這個問題。你覺得主角們會往什麼方向前進？你覺得其他人會如何看待他們？你認為是什麼在推動他們採取行動？創建引鉤的過程能夠豎立這些問題和想法，並讓你能夠在遊戲過程中強調它們。

在你們第一次聚會結束後創造一些引鉤，並總是在聚會和聚會之間的空檔檢查它們。如果你感覺某一對引鉤已經被解決了──尤其是如果PC已經固定了其中一個與引鉤相關的標籤屬性──那麼就該是時候為這個PC創造一對新引鉤了。通常來說，你可以持續使用同一對引鉤大約三到四次聚會，並在這之後改變衝突的內容，轉為聚焦另一組新的標籤屬性。

當你創造一對新的引鉤時：
* 選擇被這對引鉤拉扯的PC
* 選擇涉及的標籤屬性
* 為引鉤指派NPC


### 選擇PC
你最終會需要為每個PC安排至少一對引鉤，協助你思考該如何拉扯每一個PC的自我印象。
當你在選擇要為哪一個PC創建新的引鉤時，你只需要選擇那些尚未被安排引鉤、或者上一個引鉤已經被解決掉了的PC。

當你選好PC之後，看一下他們的標籤屬性，並仔細留意有誰擁有對他們的影響力、有誰會被他們給影響、以及任何跟他們有關的其他角色。


### 選擇標籤屬性
每一組標籤屬性都描繪著一種不同類型的衝突、一組截然不同的議題。
舉例來說，「危險 VS 救助」的搭配就是在述說關於摧毀敵人以及拯救性命之間的張力；而另一方面，「危險 VS 古怪」的組合則是在探討關於怪異而強大的表現、以及彷彿是個真正的威脅之間的微妙界線。

引鉤中的每個標籤屬性都帶有一個「推力」，告訴你這個引鉤用來把PC往特定標籤屬性拉扯的大致方向和動力是什麼。
舉例來說，古怪屬性的引鉤可能會有一個寫著「孤立並趕走他人」的推力，而平凡屬性引鉤的推力則可能會寫著「使其平常普通」。
當你要使用這些引鉤時，試著去尋找各種方式來讓古怪屬性引鉤把PC孤立起來，讓他們感到與眾不同、格格不入、與孤獨；而平凡屬性引鉤則反過來，提供他們維持正常的表象的手段，無論是讓他們感覺自己平凡無奇、或是要求他們隱藏自己的怪異之處並表現得像個「正常人」一樣。

#### 搭配: 危險 VS 古怪

This pairing is about power—especially when it gets out of hand. PCs involved 
in a Danger vs Freak pairing are often the most powerful of their team, capable 
of rewriting existence or causing massive destruction. Those around them 
question whether they can be trusted with their power—maybe because they’re 
kids or because they have more power than anybody should be trusted with.

* 引鉤推力 — 危險: 提醒他們的附帶傷害
* 引鉤推力 — 古怪: 突顯他們的怪異和能力
</div><div class='Move'>

#### 搭配: 危險 VS 平凡
This pairing is about fear. PCs involved in a Danger vs Mundane pairing are 
viewed with understanding by those close to them, and fear by others—until 
things go wrong, and the fear may spread like wildfire. But can they show those 
who fear them that they’re just a person at heart? Or will they turn out to be 
the threat everyone worries can’t be stopped?

* 引鉤推力 — 危險: 去猜疑和煽動
* 引鉤推力 — 平凡: 中斷危險的情境發展
</div><div class='Move'>

#### 搭配: 危險 VS 救助
This pairing is about heroic roles. PCs involved in a Danger vs Savior pairing 
are torn between defeating enemies and saving lives. When they’re caught in a 
dangerous fight, they’re not sure if they should take down the villain fast and 
hard or if they should focus on keeping people safe at the cost of potentially 
letting the villain escape. 

* 引鉤推力 — 危險: 推向戰鬥
* 引鉤推力 — 救助: 遠離直接的戰鬥，推向拯救人命
</div><div class='Move'>

#### 搭配: 危險 VS 優越
This pairing is about control. Superior characters are good at looking around, 
taking in the environment, understanding it, using it...and provoking other 
people to do what they want. Surgical strikes and efforts. Dangerous characters 
are good at punching enemies in the face, at letting loose, at breaking things 
down.  Characters  caught  in  these  arcs  are  stuck  between  precision  and 
uncontrolled venting. 

* 引鉤推力 — 危險: To infuriate and provoke
* 引鉤推力 — 優越: To point out failures of control and planning
</div><div class='Move'>

#### 搭配: 古怪 VS 平凡
This pairing is about fitting in, usually focusing on one of two angles: either 
the PC is especially strange, notably different from the people around them, 
and unsure if they’ll ever fit in...or they’re especially normal, and they don’t 
feel different enough. Either way, the people involved in this pairing push them 
either further in sync with the normal people of Halcyon City, or push them 
to be alone, separate from the people around them by their own strangeness.

* 引鉤推力 — 古怪: 孤立並趕走他人
* 引鉤推力 — 平凡: 使其平常普通
</div><div class='Move'>

#### 搭配: 古怪 VS 優越 
This pairing is about being special. A character who is caught in this pairing 
hears voices on one side telling them they’re better, stronger, and more capable 
than everyone around them, and voices on the other side calling them a 
worthless monster. Either way, they’re struggling to make sense of what their 
difference means.

* 引鉤推力 — 古怪: To call out the flaws of strangeness
* 引鉤推力 — 優越:  To  praise  the  power  and  ability  of strangeness
</div><div class='Move'>

#### 搭配: 古怪 VS 救助 
This pairing is about responsibility. What responsibilities does someone with 
intense power have? Are they beholden only to their own power? Or are they 
burdened with the need to make use of their powers for the greater good? 

* 引鉤推力 — 古怪: To praise immense power and abilities
* 引鉤推力 — 救助: To place responsibility
</div><div class='Move'>

#### 搭配: 平凡 VS 優越
This pairing is about human connection. Characters with a high Mundane 
can connect with other people on a meaningful level...but they can’t get those 
people to reliably do what they want. Characters with a high Superior, on 
the other hand, can manipulate other people and their environment much 
more directly, but they’re more aloof and detached from those people. With 
this pairing, play up that detachment, the cost of feeling superior and the 
compromises required of being mundane.

* 引鉤推力 — 平凡: To require compromise for connection
* 引鉤推力 — 優越: To detach and distance from others
</div><div class='Move'>

#### 搭配: 平凡 VS 救助 
This pairing is about saving others—protecting them from outward and inner 
threats. Saviors are great at stopping a car flying through the air at someone’s 
face, but Mundane characters can actually make people feel better, and might 
even be able to save villains from themselves.

* 引鉤推力 — 平凡: To ask for empathy and mercy
* 引鉤推力 — 救助:  To  demand  defense  and  protection  for 
innocents
</div><div class='Move'>

#### 搭配: 救助 VS 優越
This pairing is about whether heroes should be proactive or reactive. Saviors 
respond to threats...but superior PCs read the situation and manipulate those 
around them to take action. They solve problems proactively, at the cost of 
being coldly removed from those around them. Which method is truly heroic? 
Fighting the good fight or winning the war?

* 引鉤推力 — 救助: To highlight impending threats
* 引鉤推力 — 優越: To present opportunities for action
</div>

### 指派NPC
After selecting the pairing for your hooks, assign the 
hooks themselves to either side of the pairing. A hook 
is a fictional element embodying the pull on the PC 
in the direction of a particular Label. It’s the Janus’s 
mother, pulling the Janus to be more and more 
Mundane. It’s the Protégé’s mentor, pulling the 
Protégé to be more and more Superior. 

Hooks should almost always be characters. If 
you feel very strongly that a location or item could 
pull the PC in a particular direction, then use 
it as a hook, but try to stick to characters. 
They can be villains, or they can be friends, or 
family members, or anyone, so long as they’d 
pull the PC in one direction of the pairing. 

Whenever you can, use the same NPCs 
across multiple pairings. That way, you 
instantly generate PC-NPC-PC triangles. 
When the Protégé’s mentor wants 
the Protégé to be more 
of a Savior, but 
continuously 
tells the 
Transformed 
they’re a Danger, there’s 
instant tension, even between those two PCs. 
Reusing the NPCs keeps your game tight and 
focused on that particular set of characters. 

If necessary, you can make up a new 
character to use as a hook for a pairing, but try 
to use characters that are already in your game, even if they’re 
only mentioned on someone’s character sheet when you’re 
filling in your hooks.

## 如何使用引鉤
Set up your hooks between sessions. Doing so makes you think about who 
these characters are, and ask yourself questions about what they might become. 
During play, use your list of hooks as a reference sheet for your moves. 

When you’re at a loss for the next scene, bring the characters together with 
their hooks, and pull them towards the Labels involved. Set scenes using the 
hooks, and push their Labels hard. If you need to make a hard move, have one 
of the hooks take Influence on the PC and shift their Labels.

Use your list of hooks to remind you of the character’s big, primary issue, 
as well. NPCs not even directly involved in the pairing can still poke and push 
and pull at those Labels. When you aren’t sure which Label to shift, think about 
the pairings and the hooks, and try to angle for those Labels.

At the end of every session, ask yourself if it’s still an open question whether 
the PC is one Label or the other. Does the player think it’s resolved? Do you? If 
so, then change that pairing to a new one. If not, then keep that pairing steady, 
and think about other ways to pull on those Labels with those hooks.

## 成對引鉤的範例
{{< hint info >}}
我正在思考要為異變者雷克斯安排什麼樣的引鉤。到目前為止，雷克斯的態度一直都相當粗暴；他很顯然對自己那怪異的身體感到煩躁。他有著相當高的古怪屬性和特別低的平凡屬性……但他也救下了天樂女，而且他一直試著表現得像是個救助者，當在她身邊時尤其如此。我知道我不能選擇天樂女作為引鉤──畢竟她是玩家角色──但我在考慮著要給雷克斯的問題：也許是「他是古怪還是救助的？」或「他是危險還是古怪的？」

最後我選擇了「他是古怪還是平凡的？」 這不僅符合他現在的標籤屬性，也讓我能更容易想出這一對引鉤的內容。對於古怪屬性的人選，很顯然會是山繆．塞爾利，這位熱愛談論雷克斯的長相有多嚇人的電視名嘴。我會需要調整一下山繆的言論使其更聚焦在古怪而非危險的方向，但這好解決。至於平凡屬性的人選，我在考慮選擇蚱蜢女俠的小妹妹席亞拉。席亞拉是在雷克斯把她從刺客凱洛的手中救下時認識他的──我認為讓席亞拉像對待正常人一樣看待雷克斯將會相當有趣。我們還沒有在遊戲中看過他們同框的情況，但我喜歡把既有的角色整合再利用，並決定把蚱蜢女俠加進來，創造出一個PC-NPC-PC的三角關係。
