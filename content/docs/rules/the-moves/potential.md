# POTENTIAL

Every time you roll a miss on any move, you mark potential—your character 
is growing fully into their self and what they can do. Once you’ve marked five 
potential, you can take one of your advances, checking that option off the list.

The  advancement  list  is  divided  into  two  sections. You  can  only  take 
advances from the lower section once you’ve taken five from the top section. 
For more on advancement, see THE FUTURE page 113.
