# 聚會動作
There are two session moves that happen for every session you play. One 
happens when you start playing, and one happens when you’re finishing up.

<div class='Move'>
在<b>每次聚會開始</b>時，ＧＭ使團隊默契增加１點。

在<b>每次聚會結束</b>時，選擇下列其中一項：
* 你與團隊更緊密：說明誰讓你感到被接納；該角色獲得對你的影響力，並清除一個狀態或獲得1點潛能
* 你加深對自己的印象：說明你如何看待自己以及其理由；選擇一個標籤屬性上升，一個標籤屬性下降
* 你變得更遠離團隊：說明你為什麼感到疏離。移除另一個角色對你的影響力
</div>

The start of session move happens only once, and is there just to get some 
Team in the pool for the players to spend.

Every player performs the end of session move, one at a time. It’s entirely 
their own choice which end of session move they make. You should look at 
what happened over the session to determine exactly which choice is right, 
but it’s likely a few different options will make sense. Ultimately, it’s your call 
which option you choose.

Growing  closer  to  the  team  means  you  care  more  about  your  fellow 
teammates and you’re more connected to them than you were before. If you 
feel like the bond between you and the other PCs grew, then you probably grew 
closer to the team. You ultimately need to pick one teammate in particular 
you feel you grew closer to, even if you feel like you grew closer to the whole 
group—choose the person you feel you had the greatest bond with over the 
course of the session. They get Influence over you, and all the rules apply—if 
they already have Influence over you, they immediately shift one of your Labels 
up and one down, without you being able to reject their Influence. In turn, you 
get to clear any marked condition of your choice, or mark potential. If they 
shift your Labels, they shouldn’t shift any Labels that will cause you to mark 
a condition—it’s the end of the session, and characters shouldn’t be marking 
conditions right before you stop playing.

Growing into your own image of yourself means you’re becoming more 
of how you see your adult self. It means you’re becoming closer to what you 
want to be, or at the very least what you think you will be. It’s less about your 
interactions  with  any  other  character,  and  more  about  you  becoming  an 
independent and completed person on your own. Explain to the group exactly 
what you see yourself becoming and how that was borne out over the course 
of the session, and then you get to choose one of your own Labels to shift up 
and one to shift down.

Growing away from the team means you drifted away from your teammates 
and friends. Maybe you had a fight with them, or actively disagreed with 
them...but maybe you just diverged and went different ways. You indicate that 
you no longer care about the words or opinions of a teammate in the same way, 
and take away their Influence over you. This is one of the few ways you can 
take Influence over you away from another character.
