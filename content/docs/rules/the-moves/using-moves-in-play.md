## USING MOVES IN PLAY
The most important thing to keep in mind about moves is this: to do it, you do it. 

Every move has both a mechanical element—rolling the dice and charting 
the results as a full hit, partial hit, or miss, and then determining what happens 
based on the move—and a fictional element—you charge forward and punch 
someone, or you say something mean and provocative, or what have you. You 
can’t get one without the other! To do it, you do it. 

No move ever triggers without the associated fictional action. Want to 
unleash your powers? You have to try something crazy with your abilities! 
Want to directly engage a threat? You have to throw yourself into thick of 
it and start tussling with the enemy! Want to pierce someone’s mask? You’ve 
got to be watching them for signs of what’s hidden beneath! Want to comfort 
or support someone? You’ve got to actually say something comforting or 
supporting to them!

Sometimes you’ll look at a move and say, “I want to do that thing.” You 
realize that what you really want to happen, right now, are the mechanical 
results of directly engage a threat, so you want to trigger that move. That’s 
awesome! But you don’t get to roll because you want to roll. You have to take 
some action in the fiction that triggers the move. 

The GM, at the same time, is watching for moments when a move triggers. 
Sometimes you describe yourself doing something, and the GM tells you that 
it sounds like you’re triggering a move—and that’s awesome, too! If you like, 
you can focus on just saying what your character says or does, and rely on the 
GM to help call it out when you trigger a move. 

The final thing to keep in mind is that just because there’s no move for 
it  doesn’t  mean  you  can’t  do  it!  Using  moves  is  triggering  these  specific 
combinations of fiction and rules, but you can still do things in the fiction 
without a move behind it. 


### HOLD, +1 FORWARD, AND +1 ONGOING
Some moves describe your character getting hold as a result of the move, such 
as “hold 1” or “hold 3.” These are temporary points you can spend according 
to the move, often with the phrase “spend hold one-for-one,” meaning “spend 
one point of hold for one effect as the move describes.” Usually hold has to be 
spent during a given conversation or scene, but moves tell you how long you 
have before the hold expires. If there’s ambiguity, ask the GM for clarification.

Other moves describe your character “taking +1 forward” or “taking +1 
ongoing.” +1 forward means your character gets +1 to the next applicable 
roll; +1 ongoing means your character gets +1 to all applicable rolls moving 
forward, as the move describes. The move always indicates how long these 
bonuses last.

At this point, you might be asking, “Hold up. When I punch a monster in the face, 
the  primary  way  that’s  represented  in  the  MASKS  system  is  with  an  emotional 
condition inflicted on the creature? That doesn’t make sense. It should bleed! Why 
isn’t it bleeding?”

It is! When you directly engage a threat, you’re probably hitting an enemy and 
hurting them. Follow the fiction—if you punch the Spider in the face, then yeah, 
he’s probably bleeding from a split lip. If it fits the fiction, then yeah, you might 
nerve strike an enemy’s arm into uselessness, and they’ll have to find other ways 
to come after you.

MASKS doesn’t pay close attention to physical harm, though. How much physical 
harm  can  an  invulnerable  space  alien  take  before  they  go  out?  How  much 
punishment can the utterly human bowman take? MASKS isn’t about that—in MASKS, 
their responses to getting punched are far more important. The alien gets Angry. 
The bowman gets Afraid. 

Villains always make a move after marking a condition (page 158), so the condition 
they mark says a lot about what they’ll do next. And the most common way for PCs 
to get rid of a condition is to take a particular kind of action. Marking conditions 
leads to more fiction, more things happening—and that’s exactly what you want.
