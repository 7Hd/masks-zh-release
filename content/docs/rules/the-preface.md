## What is Masks?
Ever imagine what it’d be like to punch down walls? Throw lightning from 
your fingertips? Run faster than the human eye can see? Fly? 

Ever been told “No” by a parent, teacher, boss, someone above you, maybe 
even someone you looked up to? Ever wanted to tell them, “I don’t care what 
you say,” as you go do something completely awesome?

Ever  read  stories  about  interesting,  cool,  complicated  heroes,  people 
uncertain of who they are, uncertain of what they should do, but ultimately 
striving to do the right thing in the face of impossible odds? And triumphing?

MASKS is where all those experiences connect. A game where you get to 
tell your own awesome superhero comic book stories about young people 
standing up to the world around them and paving their own way—with plenty 
of explosions and madness along the way. A game where you get to both guide 
the story and be surprised to find out where it’s going. 

When you play MASKS, you and your friends tell a story, almost as if you’re 
writing a comic together, each of you taking on the roles of the main characters 
in the story. Actual play is like a conversation, with you and your friends 
talking about those characters, what they do, and what happens. You’re each 
co-authors and readers; you get to guide where the story goes, and you get to 
be excited when it goes somewhere you never expected. 

Unlike a regular comic book, MASKS has rules that take you places you didn’t 
expect, keep things exciting and surprising, and guide you through what to 
say and when. So when you fling a car at the T-rex, instead of just saying what 
happens, the rules jump in and help fill in the next step. You have to contribute 
some, too—these rules offer guidelines that you and your group use to tell a 
story—but they’ll point you down certain paths, ones you might not’ve chosen. 
But that’s the entire point! 

If you want to tell a story where you know exactly what will happen, you 
can write it on your own. MASKS lets you play to find out what happens. When 
you throw that car, you won’t know in advance whether the T-rex will snatch it 
out of the air with terrifying jaws, or shoot it with secret cyber-dinosaur missile 
launchers, or just get decked across the face. You roll them dice and see what 
ensues, and get the enjoyment of being surprised.


## Tales to Astonish!
In addition to the story itself, the plot, the things that happen, MASKS is about 
awesome, over-the-top superheroic shenanigans. And that kind of superhero 
stuff is just damn fun. Ridiculous? Sure. A bit stupid from time to time? Yeah, 
totally. But damn fun? Without a doubt. What other stories give you time 
travelers, sorcerers, mutants, aliens, and some guy with a bow all on the same 
team? What other stories give you world-ending stakes coupled with all-too- 
personal drama, because it turns out the apocalyptic mutant demon from 
another world didn’t just possess some random guy, it possessed your brother? 
Sure, superhero stuff can get a little silly, but it’s damn fun if you go with it. 
Yeah, teen drama can get a little overwrought, but it’ll get you right in your 
feels if you let it. Embrace it!

MASKS is first and foremost about a team of young superheroes. They’re 
friends, rivals, love interests, allies…and always teammates, joint stars of their 
comic, and superheroes. They’re young; they’ve got abilities that make them 
special; they wear costumes; they use codenames; they save people; and they 
do it together. They’re growing up in Halcyon City, a place with plenty of older 
supers who provide an endless clamor of voices telling them who to be, and 
these young heroes are all trying to figure out their own way.

All of those pieces are key. You might have awesome story ideas about the 
premiere team of superheroes, or a crazy group of misfits on a spaceship, or 
genetic superhumans fighting to protect a world that hates or fears them—but 
MASKS, as it’s presented in this book, isn’t written for those stories. You’ll find 
pieces of those tales, but the core of this game is different. 

If you’re here because you love stories about young 
adults, where everything feels heightened, like 
it matters more…If you’re here because you 
love stories about growing up, the transition 
from something smaller and self-focused 
to  something  new  and  interesting  and 
capable of changing the world…If you’re 
here because you’re excited about a game 
exploring identity and self-image in the 
face  of  others’  influence…Or  if  you’re 
here because you love superhero stories, 
punching aliens, making dramatic speeches, 
and saving the world...

Then, good. You’re in the right place. 


## HALCYON CITY
There’s no place like it, anywhere else on earth. And to those who call it home, 
there’s no place better. 

Halcyon  City  is  a  massive,  bustling  megalopolis.  Gleaming  silver 
skyscrapers adorn its business districts, and assorted streets, bridges, and rails 
crisscross its body. Countless people from countless cultures and walks of life 
populate this great city. It’s a contradictory and wonderful combination of 
darkness, crime, corruption, and flaws, built on the errors of the past alongside 
light, hope, and the promise of change and growth. It’s always been the city of 
tomorrow and yesterday, and that’s never been more true than today.

Halcyon  is  the  focal  point  of  the  super-powered,  extra-normal  world. 
Caped figures soar through its skies and break into fights against terrible 
monsters and gigantic robots. Villains scheme in nefarious lairs hidden in the 
clouds over the city, while heroes meet and contemplate their next course of 
action in their golden halls of justice. Paranormal adventurers walk Halcyon 
City’s streets, looking for distortions and portals to other realms, while time 
travelers and aliens make this city their home, for better or worse. 

The city’s always had more than its share of strange heroes and goings-on, 
but since the late 1930s, it’s played home to more superhumans and their kin 
than any other place on Earth, and the city has evolved to fit its population. 
Construction crews work at ridiculous speeds to repair the damage done in 
superhuman brawls. Law enforcement has adapted to the superhuman activity 
with a unique set of responses and equipment. Halcyon hosts the headquarters 
of A.E.G.I.S., the Advanced Expert Group for Intervention and Security, an 
elite government agency that arose specifically to deal with superhumans, 
among other weird, secret, and superhuman oriented organizations.

Over  the  course  of  80  or  so  years  of  superheroes,  Halcyon  City  has 
seen three relatively distinct generations of superheroes rise and fall. These 
three generations are known colloquially as the Gold Generation, the Silver 
Generation, and the Bronze Generation. And now...there’s a new generation 
rising. The children of other superheroes, or trainees of prior generations, or 
brand new superpowered individuals, all trying to figure out who they are in 
the midst of Halcyon City’s own special brand of wonder and insanity.

That’s you. You’re the new generation, and soon enough, this city with its 
amazing miracles and impossible wonders will be yours. Who will you be when 
it’s time to inherit Halcyon’s reins? What will you make of the place? Whose 
butts will you kick on the way?


## FINDING YOURSELF
So there you are. You’ve got your cape. You’ve got your superpowers. You’ve 
got a cool name you spent a while thinking about. You’ve even got a team of 
friends. And you’re in the greatest city on earth. 

What now? Where do you go? Who will you become?

In MASKS, you play characters who are approximately 16 to 20 years old 
(with allowances made for stuff like the alien who’s actually 1,000 years old 
and is still a teenager in mind and body). They’re trying to figure out who they 
are, but they’re not so young as to have no idea at all. The trouble is all these 
adults around them, telling them what to do and who to be. Everybody has a 
vested interest in making these young heroes one thing or another—from their 
parents, who might just want them to be normal and safe and human, to their 
mentors who want them to be noble and heroic and upright, to their enemies 
who want them to be dangerous or free or arrogant. 

It’s the story we all face as we grow up. We don’t just become exactly what 
our parents, teachers, or mentors want us to be...and we don’t completely 
abandon or ignore what they say, either, whether we want to or not. 

MASKS is all about that story. It’s about seeing these young superheroes go 
through the wringer, get thrown into crazy superhero fights, get pushed and 
changed by the words and ideas of those around them, and then at the end, 
seeing who they’ve become. Sometimes, they’ll be heroes. Sometimes, they’ll 
be monsters. Either way? It’ll be an awesome ride.


## PLAYING TO FIND OUT
There may be times while playing MASKS when you say, “Oh! I know exactly 
what happens next!” You feel like you have the best possible idea for a stream 
of events to take your character to some interesting place, and you just want 
to say what those are. 

Don’t. 

The characters in MASKS don’t really know where they belong, where they’ll 
end up, who they’ll become, and you don’t either. This is a story of uncertainty 
and discovery. Don’t cheat yourself out of that excitement by planning the next 
dramatic arc in detail. Don’t force a rivalry or romance or convince yourself 
that your character needs to die in the next fight. Just let it happen.

The mechanics in MASKS will push you in new and different directions, taking 
you places you wouldn’t have expected. It’ll take some discipline to really 
adhere to those mechanics and go where they’re taking you, but it’s worth it. So 
much of the fun of MASKS lies in the surprise of finding out what happens, who 
the characters are becoming, without knowing in advance. Commit yourself 
to that uncertainty—you’ll be glad you did.


## WHERE THIS CAME FROM
MASKS  borrows  its  rules  framework,  and  many  ideas  about  stories  and 
storytelling, from the game APOCALYPSE WORLD by D. Vincent Baker. APOCALYPSE WORLD 
is a mature game (think R rating) about the post-apocalyptic wasteland. MASKS 
is pretty different in terms of subject matter and style, but the basic spine of 
both games is the same: both are about playing to discover, about dynamic 
characters changing in reaction to each other and the world around them, 
about stories that go to places you’d never expect.

You don’t need APOCALYPSE WORLD to play MASKS; everything you need to play 
this game is included in this book. But if you want to take a look at APOCALYPSE 
WORLD (and you’re comfortable with its mature content level), then it’s well 
worth your time.

MASKS also comes from a long tradition of young superhero stories. Here’re a 
few worth checking out to get an idea of the style and themes of MASKS:

*  少年正義聯盟 Young Justice (卡通電視影集 by  Brandon  Vietti  &  Greg Weisman)
*  少年復仇者 Young Avengers  (第一冊 by  Allan  Heinberg & Jim  Cheung, 以及 第二冊 by Kieron Gillen & James McKelvie)
*  復仇者學院 Avengers Academy (by Christos Gage & Mike McKone)
*  離家童盟 Runaways (by Brian K. Vaughn & Adrian Alphona)
*  少年悍將 Teen Titans (原創卡通網路影集, 以及 漫畫 by Marv Wolfman 和Geoff Johns 發行的版本)
*  驚奇女士 Ms. Marvel (by G. Willow Wilson & Adrian Alphona)
*  金鋼狼與X戰警 Wolverine and the X-Men (by Jason Aaron & Chris Bachalo)


## WHAT YOU’LL NEED
To play MASKS, you need a few friends willing to commit to playing at least one 
2 to 4 hour session. A single session of MASKS is fun, but the game really sings 
when you play multiple linked sessions. 

MASKS needs one player to be the Gamemaster or GM—that’s a special role 
with responsibilities slightly different from the other players, see THE GM page 
125 for more—and 3 to 5 players to play the main characters of the game, the 
Player Characters or PCs.  

You also need some additional supplies. Usually the GM brings a lot of 
these resources, but just make sure someone is bringing them. Having this book 
at the table in some form is pretty useful, too.

### DICE
You need at least two six-sided dice, like the kind you find in Monopoly or 
Risk. One pair is enough to play, but it’s a lot better to have one pair of dice 
for each player. 

### PLAYBOOKS
You need a printed copy of each of the ten core playbooks. Each one can be 
printed, landscape, on regular letter paper. You can add in a few limited edition 
playbooks or take out a few core playbooks to adjust the mix, but make sure 
you’ve got a wide variety printed and ready. 

### PENCILS AND PAPER
You’ll want plenty of pencils, at least one for each player—throughout the game, 
the players mark up and make changes to their character sheets, so they need 
pencils for sure. You’ll also want plenty of scrap paper, either notebooks or index 
cards or post-its, so you can write down names and notes throughout the game.

### ADDITIONAL MATERIALS
Some other materials you’ll need or want:
* Tokens for Influence, at least one set of about 5 distinct tokens for each player (the Hero Deck has cards that act as tokens, if you have it)
* Some  inspirational  art  and  pictures,  to  generate  ideas  (the  Deck  of Villainy has a pantheon of villains, for example)
* Printed copies of the basic moves, one for each player

A printed copy of the GM materials You can find the sheets for running a game of MASKS as downloads, and more 
information on the Hero Deck and the Deck of Villainy, at www.magpiegames.

{{< expand "邊欄：為什麼叫「蒙面」少俠？" "..." >}}
The name of the game is MASKS. There’s a rules piece in the game called pierce 
the mask. The chapter including the playbooks is called THE MASKS. Why such an 
emphasis on masks? 

On one level, the game is about superheroes—and the association of masks with 
those costumed superpeople is pretty well ingrained, thanks to nearly a century of 
such stories. 

But on another level, the game is about appearances, image, and perception. It’s 
about the conflict between what you seem to be, and what you actually are. 
Everybody  wears  masks.  Everyone’s  fitting  into  some  kind  of  image  or  mold, 
playing some kind of role. Everyone has a “mask” to pierce, even if they’re not 
wearing anything on their face. The playbooks you choose, the appearances of your 
characters, their secret identities and their superhero names—all masks, of one 
form or another.

Embrace masks. Revel in putting them on, taking them off, trying on new ones, 
abandoning old ones.
