# 雙子 The Joined

<div class="playbookDesc">
	You'd be nothing without them - your parter, your sibling, your friend, your rival, your other half.
	You're tied th their powers and to them, through and through.
	The rest of the world only ever sees you two as halves of a whole -- not as two seperate people.
	And the two of you aren't sure if they're right.
</div>

{{< details title="如何扮演雙子" >}}
Unsure, supportive, jealous, defiant. The Joined is a mix of emotions and ideas, defined
more by the hero to whom they are connected than by anything else. The Joined is
different from any other playbook in Masks, and making it work requires substantial
buy-in from all the players involved. Don’t play the Joined unless both you and the other
player are on-board.

Both the Joined’s player and their partner player need to be okay with shared
uniqueness. You will share in a lot of the same powers and abilities, and in some ways
that diminishes the other character’s uniqueness. No one should agree to play your other
half if they really want to have sole access to their playbook’s cool stuff.

Because of the connection between the two characters, creating the Joined is a much
more collaborative process. You can’t start the Joined without knowing to whom you are
connected, and you should let them finish a lot of the initial steps of their character before
you get into the Joined. As such, creating a Joined can’t be a “heads-down” kind of thing.
Talk to the other player and bounce ideas off each other throughout the process.

During play, you will obviously spend a lot of time with the character to whom you are
joined. But make sure your Joined develops relationships with the other PCs, outside of
that primary connection. The story of the Joined moves toward separation and distinction,
and you can’t have that story without the opportunity for each half to define themself
independently.

Use locking a Label to mark the moments when your Joined defines themself separately
from their other half. Most of the time, locking a Label comes after using a Moment
of Truth, so watch out for when you or your other half wants to do that. Remember
that when either of you locks a Label, a bond switches to a distinction. If you have no
more bonds to switch to distinctions, then you’re already pretty divided—nothing extra
happens.

### 關於你的動作 & 額外事物
For Your other half, you’re probably going to need to borrow your other half ’s
playbook for a bit, to jot down all the relevant information. It may help for you to
have a spare copy of their playbook yourself.

For Fastball Special and Powers, Activate!, you’ll need to say who’s in the lead.
Go with your gut about which one of you is leading the maneuver. If you and
your other half wind up talking too long about it, then that’s the equivalent of
giving the GM a golden opportunity—instead of doing your cool maneuver,
you’re bickering.

For Going solo, you really have to engage the threat on your own. If any teammate
could potentially spend Team from the pool to help you, then you’re not really
on your own.

For Internal strife, sniping about your other half behind their back requires you
to have an audience—you can’t just grumble to yourself, under your breath.

## 外貌
<div class="Instructions">You look similar to your other half, and your costume choice is always the same as theirs.
Choose two other options they have selected that you share; then, choose two options from the lists below.</div>

* 男性, 女性, 模稜兩可, 性別認同轉變, 性別越界
* 亞洲或南亞裔, 黑人, 西班牙/拉丁美洲人, 印地安人, 中東人, 白人
* brooding face, curious face, judging face, unreadable face
* casual clothing, eccentric clothing, dark clothing, light clothing

## 超能力
<div class="Instructions">
Your powers complement your other half’s. You have the same abilities they have. At least for now.</div>

## 標籤屬性
<div class="Instructions">Your Labels start off the same as your other half ’s, but you may shift up any one Label, and shift down any one Label.</div>

## 背景故事
* How did you and your other half become connected?
* Who or what did you have to give up because of your connection?
* Apart from your powers, what keeps you together?
* Someone outside the team thinks you’d be better off on your own. Who are they and why do they think that?
* Why do you care about the team?

## 關鍵時刻
<div class="Move">
When you trigger your Moment of Truth, choose—are you working with your other half, or are you on your own?

If you’re working with your other half, use the text of their Moment of Truth and treat it as if it
applies to both of you. Remember to lock your Label and switch a bond to a distinction because
you’ll probably never reach these heights of perfect connection, of being one, ever again…

If you’re on your own, use the following text:

You’re on your own. It’s like missing an arm. Like fighting naked. Like holding your breath. You’re
missing something vital...but you’re moving faster than ever, thinking faster than ever, doing
things you couldn’t even do while relying on both of your strength combined. And it’s hitting you,
hard—you can do this. Without them. And you can win. It’s going to be hard to come down off
this high and rejoin with them afterwards, isn’t it?

Remember to lock a Label and switch a bond to a distinction, afterward.

## 團隊動作
<div class="Move">
	When one of you shares moment of vulnerability or shares a triumphant celebration without the other one present, mark a condition to mark a potential.
</div>

## 額外事物
<div class="Move">

### 〈Your Other Half〉
You share a deep bond with your other half. You are stronger together than you are apart, for
now. If your other half is a Delinquent, Outsider, or Transformed, take two moves from their
playbook: one they have and one they don’t. Remember that you share much beyond your moves;
i.e., if your other half is an Outsider, you both hail from the same dimension/planet/etc. For all
other playbooks, you share in the core extras of your other half.

* Beacon:<br>
Take drives and mark four of your
choice. When your other half strikes out a drive,
strike it out as well.

* Bull:<br>
Take The Bull’s Heart with the same love
and rival as your other half. Choose a different
role that you commonly fulfill.

* Janus:<br>
Take The Mask and a secret identity.
Choose a different Label for your Mask. Take two
obligations: one shared, one unique to you.

* Legacy:<br>
Take a legacy. Your other half fills in as
many names in the initial list as they choose;
you fill in the rest. You can never answer the
questions for your other half’s Legacy move.

* Protégé:<br>
You share a mentor with your other
half. When they finish defining your mentor and
resources, choose an additional resource.

* Doomed:<br>
Take a sanctuary, a doom, and a
doom track: You and your other half share the
conditions that bring your doom closer and a
doom track; when it fills, you both choose a
new doomsign. You start with the doomsign
your other half chose. Your other half picks the
initial features and downsides of your shared
sanctuary. You choose one more of each.

* Nova:<br>
Take burn and four flares, two shared and
two unique to you.
</div>
<div class="Move">

### 〈Bonds and Distinctions〉
At character creation you start with Two of a kind, and choose one other bond. When either you or
your other half locks a Label, cross off one of your chosen bonds and choose a distinction.

##### BONDS:
* 【Two of a kind】<br>
When time passes, you and your
other half gain Influence over each other. When
you or your other half pierces the

* 【Fastball special】<br>
When you perform a coordinated
fighting maneuver with your other half, say who
takes the lead and who assists. The leader rolls
the adult move overwhelm a vulnerable foe. The
assistant marks a condition.

* 【Powers, activate!】<br>
When you and your other half
pool your powers, say who takes the lead and who
assists. The leader unleashes their powers with
your combined Freak (max+4). The assistant shifts
Savior down, Mundane up.

* 【Four eyes are better】<br>
When you and your other half
assess the situation from two different vantage points,
one of you makes the move, and the other may either
clear a condition or ask an additional question. You
both get +1 when following the answers.


##### DISTINCTIONS:
* 【Mirror, mirror】<br>
When you pierce someone’s mask,
you can ask them “What are you really feeling right
now?”, even on a miss. If you do, they can ask you
the same question.

* 【Shouldering the burden】<br>
When you push yourself
to do something your other half failed at or can’t
do, mark a condition to use the adult move wield
your powers.

* 【Going solo】<br>
When you directly engage a threat
entirely on your own, you can roll + Superior
instead of + Danger.

* 【Internal strife】<br>
When you snipe about your other
half behind their back, remove one Team from the
pool and clear a condition.
