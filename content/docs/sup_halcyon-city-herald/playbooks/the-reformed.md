# 改邪歸正者 The Reformed

<div class="playbookDesc">
	Villainy used to be a way of life for you. Then you saw just what your selfishness and hate created.
	The supervillain life is hard one to quit. But you know this best: sometimes the villain needs saving too.
</div>

{{< details title="如何扮演改邪歸正者" >}}
Haunted, redemptive, dangerous, tarnished. The Reformed is still young, but even in their
short time they’ve done things—if not quite unforgivable, then pushing the limits. They
filled the role of the villain, and they did it willingly and knowingly. And now they’re
trying to do better, to be better, but redemption doesn’t come that easily.

The key to playing the Reformed is to keep in mind that you’ve already been there.
You’ve already walked on the dark side. You’ve already done bad things. Not just silly
little pranks or tricks, the way the Delinquent might have. You were a villain. And you
specifically chose to abandon that life to be better. So while you may be drawn to take
criminal action, you’re also trying not to. You’re fighting your base impulses. Your bad
habits. Maybe even your addictions.

That said, your old life wasn’t all bad. Yeah, you aren’t going to rob banks or hurt
people anymore, but you made friends. You developed relationships. And you got to
know those people the other heroes are all too likely to just dismiss as “villains.” It’s not
so easy to just cut all those people and relationships out of your life, especially when
they’re trying to pull you back in. Don’t hesitate to go to those characters outlined in
your Friends in Low Places for help, even if you are trying to be as noble as possible.
Those people have some hold on you, but also you have relationships with them.

Finally, embrace the conflict likely to come from your teammates mistrusting you, or
the world mistrusting you. Don’t play the Reformed if you want to be assured that others
are going to see you as heroic. Your teammates and the world at large are all likely to come
at you harder than they might for any other character, but that’s what you signed up for.

### 關於你的動作 & 額外事物
For What the hell, hero, you get to determine the nature of the injustice you call
out. It shouldn’t be just a small perceived slight—the point of the move is to let
you accuse more heroic types of wrongdoing, forcing them to perk up and listen
because it’s a former villain doing it. They don’t have to agree with you that they
committed an injustice, nor does anyone else, when you trigger the move. For
”You win over an onlooker,” at the GM’s discretion this can be interpreted as a
crowd of individuals.

For Dark past, triggering the move allows you to fill in pieces of your past. Don’t
confess to crimes that it would make absolutely no sense for you to have done—
your confession has to be real and true to trigger the move. It also has to be a
serious crime. No misdemeanors or small transgressions. Whatever you confess
has to have hurt someone in some way.

For Blowing off steam, the GM is the final arbiter of whether or not the crime
actually qualifies for the trigger. As long as you’re doing something illegal,
something that you shouldn’t be doing, but that doesn’t directly, obviously, or
significantly harm anyone, the move should trigger.

Do me a favor gives you the ability to go to civilian contacts for help. The
Reformed is plugged into criminals and villains, and this move may help you
ask for favors from those networks. It also allows you to ask for help from people

## 關鍵時刻
<div class="Move">
  You’ve seen your greatest mistakes, and the rest of the world has, too. They’re all watching you
now, judging every move you make. When everything is on the line and your back is against the
wall, though, you’ll show them what you’re made of—that being a hero is a choice. An act of will.
And you’ve got what it takes to save the day. Of course, afterward, you can expect both sides, hero
and villain, to deeply question where your loyalties truly lie...
</div>

## 團隊動作
<div class="Move">
	When you share a moment of triumph with someone, ask them what gives them hope for a
brighter day and give them Influence.
</div>
<div class="Move">
	When you share a vulnerability or weakness with someone, ask them what they would do

</div>

## 額外事物
<div class="Move">

### 〈Friends in Low Places〉
You have ties to villains from your previous career. Choose three names to fill in:
* Finch, Ellen “Devil” Drummond, Mr. Cane, The Mad Magpie, Dr. Cutler, Armorer, Tegan Queen, Lovelace

For each of them, choose a specialty.

* _______________ Specialty: weapons, materials, cosmic artifacts, alien tech, insider info<br>
Obligation:□□□□

* _______________ Specialty: weapons, materials, cosmic artifacts, alien tech, insider info<br>
Obligation:□□□□

* _______________ Specialty: weapons, materials, cosmic artifacts, alien tech, insider info<br>
Obligation:□□□□

* _______________ Specialty: weapons, materials, cosmic artifacts, alien tech, insider info<br>
Obligation:□□□□

When you create your character, mark two obligations on one villain, and mark one obligation on another.

When you come to them for help with your problems, mark obligation on them and they’ll help out within their specialty. If all their boxes are full, then they won’t help you until you help them.

When time passes, roll + your highest obligation. On a 10+, they come crashing into your life with a crisis. On a 7-9, they call for a favor. On a miss, they don’t come knocking yet, but mark obligation with them—the debts are getting heavier.

When you help one of these villains with their problems, erase two obligations on them.
</div>



## 扮演書動作
<div class="Instructions">選擇二個：</div>
<div class="Move">

### 〈What the hell, hero〉
When you call out an injustice that a hero has perpetrated, roll + Danger. On a hit, take Influence over them. On a 7-9, choose one. On a 10+, choose two.
- You get them to admit their wrongdoing
- You win over an onlooker; take Influence over them
- You don’t turn their attention and anger onto yourself

On a miss, they dismiss you; mark a condition (their choice), shift Danger up, Savior down.
</div>
<div class="Move">

### 〈Wrong side of the tracks〉
You always get to
ask an additional question when you pierce
the mask of a villain, even on a miss. When you
pierce the mask of a hero (your call), add this
question to the list:
- what was your darkest moment?
</div>
<div class="Move">

### 〈Not so different〉
When you provoke someone to
criminal or villainous action, you can use Danger
instead of Superior.
</div>
<div class="Move">

### 〈Dark past〉
When you confess to a serious crime
you committed as a villain while in the presence of
someone involved, shift Danger up and any other
Label down, say what you did, and choose one.

- You aren’t in legal danger from the crime
- You aren’t being actively pursued for extralegal retribution

### 〈Do me a favor〉
When you go to an ordinary civilian
you know for a favor, roll + Mundane. On a 10+,
they’ll lend you a hand. On a 7-9, they need a
promise up front. On a miss, you catch them up in
your superpowered nonsense, and they suffer for it.
