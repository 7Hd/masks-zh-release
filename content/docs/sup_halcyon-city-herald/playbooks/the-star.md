# 明星 The Star

<div class="playbookDesc">
	Being a hero isn't just about doing right. It's about being seen doing right.
	Let them think you're shallow for loving the spotlight and the cameras, for making speeches, for smiling so much.
	You'll be a hero in all the ways that matter.
</div>

{{< details title="如何扮演明星" >}}
Arrogant, ambitious, flamboyant, delightful. The Star is a young celebrity, aware of their
status and interested in obtaining more of it. They’re a showboat, but they’re also still a
superhero, and those two poles pull them in drastically different directions. Should they
make sure they land the last strike on the villain, so they can take the credit? Or should
they avoid interfering with their teammate’s fight and possibly messing things up?

The questions are complicated by your audience. When you play as the Star, your
audience is a constant presence intruding upon your life. They will tell you who you are
and, more than anything, they’ll try to reshape you into what they want. But they also
provide you with help when you need it, when you speak to them or organize them for a
particular end. Don’t play the Star unless you’re already interested in interacting with the
audience regularly and juggling their impression of you along with actual heroics.

Remember that your audience is your audience and that, while people may be paying
attention to you as part of a team, they’re also paying attention to you individually. That’s
another source of fruitful tension for the Star, whether they belong to a team or are an
individual celebrity. Play into it, and don’t hesitate to be a bit of a heel sometimes, trying
to nab all the attention for yourself.

Most importantly, always keep in mind that the Star, while a celebrity, is also still a
hero. They may be interested in their own popularity quite a bit. They may desperately
be trying to stay in the news. But they’re also still ultimately interested in helping people,
in making things better. If someone is in pain in front of them, they won’t just let it keep
going. If you veer too much into making decisions purely for the audience, then your
character will become unsympathetic fast.

### 關於你的動作 & 額外事物
For Time for the show, a flamboyant display of your powers needs to primarily
be just that—a flamboyant display. It doesn’t trigger if you are using another
move, but flamboyantly. If you’re trying to stop a building from falling down,
but you’re doing it flamboyantly, the move won’t trigger. But if you’re standing
on a stage juggling fireballs, then you are doing a flamboyant display, and the
move will trigger.

Stage-fighting requires you to fight with an audience watching. “An audience”
is more than just a couple people. If you’re fighting in an abandoned warehouse
with five hostages watching, then the move won’t trigger. But if you’re fighting in
the city streets with news choppers following you, it will.

Cold and cruel requires you to shut someone down. That could involve outright
telling them to shut up or it could involve a cold look, but it has to be clear to both
parties that you are demeaning, insulting, or reducing them.

Seeking help from your audience is when you are either putting out a general call
for aid from your audience, or searching through people you know to be fans to
find someone who can help you out. You aren’t necessarily speaking to the group,
so much as combing through them to see if anyone can give you a hand. It takes
some time, so it’s unlikely that you can trigger the move in the middle of a fight,
unless your audience is right there.

## 標籤屬性
<div class="Instructions">在創建角色時，自行選擇一個標籤屬性 +1。</div>
　危險-1　　古怪+1　　救助+1　　優越+2　　平凡-1

## 背景故事
* When did you first appear onscreen?
* What do you tell people about how you got your powers?
* Who, outside of the team, supports your burgeoning star in every way possible?
* Who, outside of the team, loathes what you represent?
* 你為什麼在乎這個團隊？

## 關鍵時刻
<div class="Move">
Sometimes it can be hard to tell where the show stops and where you begin—but not today. Not
now. Because right now, there is no show. Right now, you are the thing you pretend to be—bold and
bright and beautiful and amazing and powerful and confident. Right now, you draw strength from
your audience, comfort from their belief in you, and you can do anything they think you can. Of
course, after such an impassioned performance, your audience will just have even more demands...
</div>

## 團隊動作
<div class="Move">
	When you share a triumphant celebration with someone, say whether it’s part of the show or
not. If it is, then you can shift your Labels as you choose. If it is not, then they shift your Labels,
and you can clear a condition or mark potential.
</div>
<div class="Move">
	When you share a vulnerability or weakness with someone, ask them if they will tell anyone the
truth about you. If they agree to keep it a secret, clear a condition or mark potential. If they don’t
agree, the GM shifts your Labels.
</div>

## 額外事物
<div class="Move">

### 〈Audience〉
You are a celebrity in the city. By default, your audience is a limited group of interested fans, and
you speak to them through after-action interviews and infrequent press conferences. Why does
your audience love you? Mark all that apply.
* You’re just like them
* You’re a dangerous person, a bad seed
* You’re noble warrior for justice
* You’re stunning, unique, and beautiful
* You’re charming, well-spoken, and smart
* You’re a firebrand, a rabble rouser

Choose two advantages:
* Your audience is utterly devoted to you
* You can easily speak to them at any time
* You have a PR agent to handle your audience
* You earn a lot of money from their interest
* You have a major hero’s endorsement
* You have a much wider audience

Choose two demands your audience makes on you:
* They require constant stimulation
* They require perfection—no mistakes
* They require frequent bouts of drama
* They require major acts of heroism
* They require novelty and brand new action
* They require chemistry with your allies

When you accept what your audience tells you about yourself, clear a condition. When you reject
what your audience tells you about yourself, on a hit mark potential and expect retribution.

When you seek help from your audience, roll + Superior. On a hit, someone in your audience
can hook you up. On a 10+, they only make a small demand. On a 7-9, their demands are a
lot higher. On a miss, you’ve made a mistake, and your audience won’t help you until you’ve
redeemed yourself in their eyes.
</div>



## 扮演書動作
<div class="Instructions">選擇二個：</div>
<div class="Move">

### 〈The gossip mags〉
When you tap into the gossip and rumor of the celebrity industry for information on an important city figure, roll + Superior.

On a hit, you can ask the GM questions.<br>
On a 10+, ask three.<br>
On a 7-9, ask one:
- What are they up to?
- What or who do they most care about?
- What allies do they have? Enemies?
- Where and when can I find them?
- How could I make them vulnerable to me?

On a miss, ask one anyway, but they hear about
your interest in them.
</div>
<div class="Move">

### 〈Stage-fighting〉
When you directly engage a threat with an audience watching, mark a condition to roll + Superior instead of Danger.
</div>
<div class="Move">

### 〈Time for the show〉
When you put on a flamboyant display of your powers, roll + Superior.

On a 7-9, name one NPC present.<br>
On a 10+, name two NPCs present. The named NPCs must either volunteer help or information, express admiration, or ask for your help, GM’s choice.<br>
On a miss, your display catches someone watching in the wrong way.
</div>
<div class="Move">

### 〈Take it from me〉
When you comfort or support
someone who openly admires your celebrity persona,
roll + Superior instead of Mundane.
</div>
<div class="Move">

When you shut someone down, roll + Superior. 

On a 10+, you either inflict a condition on them, make them lose Influence over you, or take Influence over them, your choice. <br>

On a miss, they gain Influence over you.

We, as a team, attracted the attention of a major media outlet within the city, thanks to our efforts.
Who are they? Why do they support us?

worthwhile, give three teammates Influence.
