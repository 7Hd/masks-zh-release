# 浪子 The Nomad

<div class="playbookDesc">
	也許曾經你有過家，曾有過規律的生活。但就算你曾有過，那也已經是很久很久以前的事了。你已經在廣袤宇宙、時光歲月、和所有一切中獨自一人顛波流離了好幾年。<br>
	但現在，你離開了那遙遠星際，回到了地球。讓其他人進入你的生活，可要比穿梭在其他維度之間難得太多了。
</div>

{{< details title="如何扮演浪子" >}}
Weird, playful, mischievous, lonely. The Nomad has seen things that their peers
can’t even imagine. They’ve seen the universe at play. They’ve encountered
other cultures and ideas, and they have their own collection of cool toys. And
for all that awesomeness, the Nomad has never had their own home or family.
Their story is all about connecting deeply to the people and world around
them, instead of bouncing off to something new and different.

The two crucial questions for the Nomad during character creation are
“What brought you back to stay (for now)?” and “Why do you care about the
team?” The Nomad only works because they have chosen to remain with the
team—if they followed their wanderlust, they wouldn’t be part of a MASKS game.

Make sure that between these two questions, your Nomad has clear, durable
reasons to stick with the team. “I came back to stay because I need to get a flux
capacitor to repay my debt to the Pirate Queen of Orion” is a cool answer, but
not a durable answer—as soon as the Nomad gets the flux capacitor, they can
go back to space. “I came back to stay because I’m wanted across space for a
crime I didn’t commit” is better—as long as you remain wanted, you’re stuck
on Earth, and there’s no clear path to having that status changed.

Finally, your extra, Putting down roots, has you uniquely playing with
Influence. You are incentivized to give out Influence, for all the benefits you
get—but remember, you can only give out Influence to six characters total,
including teammates. Some of the benefits are much more advantageous when
you give Influence to an enemy than when you give it to an ally, too. And while
you can take back Influence at the end of every session, it’s otherwise pretty
hard to shift it around once you’ve given it out. Balancing the tension between
wanting to give out your Influence and picking exactly the right people to give
it to is at the heart of the whole playbook—so have fun with it!

### 關於你的動作 & 額外事物
For Out of this world, what it means to plug into the cosmic aether is up to
you. Maybe you listen to some weird music you picked up out in space; maybe
you burn some transdimensional incense and meditate. Whatever you choose,
it should be consistent—it shouldn’t shift every time you do it.

For Putting down roots, all rules not called out as different here function
as normal. For example, those you give Influence to can still shift your Labels,
and you can still reject their Influence. Your benefits are based on how many
other characters have Influence over you—meaning that if you take Influence
over you away from other characters, you may lose some of those benefits.

Note that you do not have an advancement to retire or become a paragon;
instead, you depart for reaches unknown, never to return. If you wish to retire
or become a paragon, you must change playbooks first and become someone
more settled, and less nomadic.

## 關鍵時刻
<div class="Move">
  You basically exist with one foot out the door, ready to leave this place, to go back out into the
wide expanse of the universe. You’ve never fully committed. That is, until today. Until right now.
Now, you pour everything you have and everything you are into this moment. You pull off tricks
no one from this planet has ever seen before. You use your tools in ways no one here could have
ever imagined. You devote yourself, here and now, to a cause, and you achieve your goal in ways
that you never could’ve if you’d only stayed home. Of course, now you’ve proved to everyone that
you really don’t belong here, and the very skills that let you succeed are the ones you earned from
out there...
</div>

## 團隊動作
<div class="Move">
	When you share a triumphant celebration with someone, ask them what they admire about you.
The GM will shift one of your Labels up and one down based on what they say.
</div>
<div class="Move">
	When you share a vulnerability or weakness with someone, mark a condition, give them Influence
over you, and mark potential.
</div>

## 額外事物
<div class="Move">

### 〈Putting Down Roots〉
You have one foot out the door, and it shows. Over time, you may be able to commit to this place.
* Adults do not have Influence over you by default. No one does.
* You can only give a total of 6 Influence.
* During play, you can only give Influence by revealing a vulnerability or weakness to someone. You can still give out Influence through the end of session move. You cannot give Influence to somebody who already has Influence over you.
* Others cannot take Influence over you; if they would, instead they choose: mark potential or inflict a condition on you.
* You reject Influence at -2 by default, instead of +0.
* When someone takes advantage of their  Influence over you, they can choose two options.
* At the end of a session, you can take back 1 Influence from someone you choose.
* If you have given out 0-Influence, you  cannot comfort or support anyone. If you would trigger that move, instead mark a condition as you say exactly the wrong thing. If you have given out 0-Influence and someone tries to comfort or support you, you cannot open up to them.

You gain benefits based on how much  Influence you have given out. See below. These benefits stack.
* 1-2 Influence: When you defend someone who has Influence over you, you can ignore the Insecure condition.
When you directly engage someone who has Influence over you, you can ignore the Afraid condition.
* 3 Influence: When you take a powerful blow from someone with Influence over you, take -2 to the roll.
* 4 Influence: When you pierce the mask of someone who has Influence over you, you can always ask them one question, even on a miss.
* 5 Influence: When you spend a Team to help someone who has Influence over you, it gives them +2.
* 6 Influence: When you accept the words of someone who has Influence over you, mark potential, clear a condition, or take +1 forward.

<div class="Instructions">選擇二個：</div>
<div class="Move">

### 〈No good at being a kid〉

incomplete, flawed, or tangential; the GM will
tell you how. On a miss, your experiences are
incomplete; the GM will tell you what mistake
your flawed understanding leads you to make.
</div>
<div class="Move">

### 〈I hate calling the cavalry〉
When you call the allies
you made beyond this world to ask them for help,
mark a condition and roll + Superior. On a hit,
someone shows up to lend you a hand. On a 7-9,
they’re dragging their own problems. On a miss,
your call reaches someone you wish it hadn’t.
</div>

understanding. On a miss, you realize something
dangerous or terrible; the GM will tell you what,
and shift your Labels accordingly.

When you assess the situation,
you may always ask one of the following
questions, even on a miss:
- What’s my best way out/way in/way past?
- What here would be handy to grab?
- Who here is susceptible to my words?
</div>

## 影響力
You’re here, but not, and it’s going to take some time before you really commit. Give no one Influence over you.
