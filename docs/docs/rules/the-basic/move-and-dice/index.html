<a class=anchor href=#moves-and-dice>#</a></h2><p>Framing scenes starts the conversation in an interesting place, like nocking
an arrow on the bow and aiming it at a target. But the moves carry the arrow
to the target. They connect your characters to the fiction in exciting ways,
and they drive the story in directions you might not expect. Each move is a
small set of rules that help resolve conflicts, answer questions in the fiction,
and push the story forward. Moves are like the programming language of the
game—“When you do x, then y”—shaping and defining the fiction when your
characters take action.</p><p>The basic moves are the core of the game, and any PC can trigger them
from the start of play. Each character also gets their own playbook moves,
more specific pieces of programming language that point the characters in
their own cool and interesting directions. The PCs might add more moves over
the course of play, too. In general, the basic moves cover situations that come
up all the time in MASKS stories, while the special moves cover situations that
are character specific or much more rare.</p><p>Every move has a specific trigger, the “When you do x” part of the program.
They aren’t triggered whenever, or when you feel like they should be, but only
when your characters are in situations that trigger the move. If you want to
trigger a move, you have to do the thing that triggers it. (You can also avoid
a move by avoiding its trigger.) Triggers are almost always tied to the fiction,
which means all moves are governed by the same principle: if you do it, you do
it. If you want to trigger the basic move directly engage a threat, then you have
to directly engage a threat, perhaps charging at a supervillain while screaming
and swinging your fists. And if you pick up a car in each hand and go swinging
at the giant robot, you’re directly engaging the threat, and the move triggers,
whether you like it or not.</p><blockquote class="book-hint info"><p>Marissa’s character, Toro the Bull, is in a super-science lab—like the kind that experimented on her—and she’s not happy about it.</p><p>“You recognize the gene vats, the nano-machines, all the equipment, Toro,” I say.</p><p>“It’s weirdly like coming home. And there are people, teenagers like you, floating in those gene vats on the far side of the room. The scientists in the room look at you, aghast.”</p><p>“Oh hell no,” Marissa says. “I start flinging tables over, chucking them around like crazy. I want this place messed up.”</p><p>I nod. Toro isn’t triggering a move yet; she’s super strong, so flipping these tables isn’t exactly difficult for her, and she’s unthreatened. “Yeah, you make a mess. Tables up-ended, chemicals spilled, scientists running from you. This room is trashed. That’s when a whole squad of black-armored thugs with assault rifles comes into the room. They don’t even look like they’re going to ask you to surrender, they’re just going to shoot.”</p><p>Marissa grins at me. “Awesome. I wade into their midst and start tossing them around.”</p><p>I nod. “Perfect. You’re directly engaging a threat, definitely.”</p><p>Marissa makes a face. “Oof, hold up, I didn’t think these guys were an actual danger. I’m bulletproof, right?”</p><p>“Yeah, but they’re well-trained and pouring concentrated fire your way. They’re pretty dangerous, even to you. Still want to wade in and toss ’em around?”</p><p>Marissa has time to reconsider and not take the action—she hasn’t crossed the Rubicon yet, hasn’t seen the consequences of the action.</p><p>“Yeah,” she says. “Let’s go for it.”</p><p>Marissa looks to the basic move—directly engage a threat—to find out what happens next.</p></blockquote><p>Often when you trigger a move, you roll dice to see what happens next.
These are the only times you roll dice in the whole game. You might want
to roll dice to resolve a situation at other times—don’t, until you’ve actually
done something in the game that triggers a move. Sometimes you might want
to trigger a move and go straight to rolling without describing any action in
the fiction—don’t, until you’ve done something in the game that triggers it.
Fiction first.</p><p>Some moves are just input-output without any random element. No dice
needed. See New Examplar on page 199 for an example of a move that doesn’t
need dice.</p><h2 id=hits-and-misses>HITS AND MISSES
<a class=anchor href=#hits-and-misses>#</a></h2><p>When a move asks you to roll dice, pick up two six-sided dice (hereafter
referred to as 2d6) and roll them. You’ll probably be asked to roll with
something or “+” something, like Freak, Danger, Savior, or Conditions Marked.
That means add that number to whatever comes up on the 2d6. So if you have
Danger +3, you add 3 to the results on the dice. If you have Savior -2, you
subtract 2 from the results on the dice.</p><p><b>You can never roll with more than +4, and less than -3, no matter what penalties or bonuses you’d have.</b></p><p>Every move splits up outcomes the same way. A 7 or higher is a “hit,” while
a 6 or less is a “miss.” A 10 or higher is a “strong hit,” while a 7, 8, or 9 is a “weak
hit.” Most moves give some results and changes to the fiction between strong
hits and weak hits, and some may say what happens on a miss. Follow what
the move says when you roll it.</p><p>In general, a hit means you largely keep control of the situation and
probably get some version of what you want. It’s not always exactly or all that
you wanted, but it’s the bare minimum. On a weak hit (7-9), you might get
a distorted version of what you wanted, or you might get some major costs
attached. On a strong hit (10 or higher), you might get an even better version
of what you wanted. You almost always want 10+ when you roll (except for
the one inverted move in the game, take a powerful blow—pay close attention
to that one!).</p><p>A miss, 6 or less, isn’t the same as a failure. It just means the GM gets full
say over what happens next, and chances are you won’t like it. The GM will
probably make things worse for you in some way, tighten the screws more, but
it doesn’t have to be the worst possible thing that could happen, and it doesn’t
even have to mean that you actually failed. Some of the most interesting misses
give you exactly what you wanted, in the worst possible way.</p><p>The GM doesn’t roll dice in MASKS, ever. The GM just says what happens,
making moves when a player rolls a miss, when the conversation gets boring,
or when a move tells them to contribute. These limits ensure the GM sets up
situations in which the PCs are forced to react. For more about GM moves,
check out page 135.</p><h3 id=hold-1-forward-and-1-ongoing>HOLD, +1 FORWARD, AND +1 ONGOING
<a class=anchor href=#hold-1-forward-and-1-ongoing>#</a></h3><p>Some moves describe your character getting hold as a result of the move, such
as “hold 1” or “hold 3.” These are temporary points you can spend according
to the move, often with the phrase “spend hold one-for-one,” meaning “spend
one point of hold for one effect as the move describes.” Usually hold has to be
spent during a given conversation or scene, but moves tell you how long you
have before the hold expires. If there’s ambiguity, ask the GM for clarification.</p><p>Other moves describe your character “taking +1 forward” or “taking +1
ongoing.” +1 forward means your character gets +1 to the next applicable
roll; +1 ongoing means your character gets +1 to all applicable rolls moving
forward, as the move describes. The move always indicates how long these
bonuses last.</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div></footer><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#moves-and-dice>MOVES AND DICE</a></li><li><a href=#hits-and-misses>HITS AND MISSES</a><ul><li><a href=#hold-1-forward-and-1-ongoing>HOLD, +1 FORWARD, AND +1 ONGOING</a></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
