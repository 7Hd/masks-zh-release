<a class=anchor href=#conditions>#</a></h1><p>Conditions are negative emotional states that beset the characters in your
story. Having a condition marked means that your character is experiencing
that emotion—anger, or fear, or insecurity, or whatever. You’re always in charge
of how your character is played; you can choose to play your character as calm
and dispassionate, even with Angry marked. But that means you’re holding
your anger inside, and it still impacts your actions as the story progresses.</p><h2 id=effects-and-marking-conditions>EFFECTS AND MARKING CONDITIONS
<a class=anchor href=#effects-and-marking-conditions>#</a></h2><p>Conditions impact and interfere with your ability to take action. Each
condition gives you an ongoing -2 to certain moves. Remember that the lowest
modifier you can roll a move with is -3.</p><p>When a move tells you to mark a condition, unless it says otherwise, mark
any condition you choose. Sometimes the GM tells you a specific condition
to mark, especially after a hard move. If you need to mark a condition and all
conditions are already marked, you’re taken out. You lose consciousness or flee
the scene—one way or another, you cannot continue there.</p><p>The conditions and their associated penalties are:</p><ul><li>If you’re Angry, take -2 to comfort or support someone or pierce the mask.</li><li>If you’re Afraid, take -2 to directly engage.</li><li>If you’re Guilty, take -2 to provoke someone or assess the situation.</li><li>If you’re Hopeless, take -2 to unleash your powers.</li><li>If you’re Insecure, take -2 to defend or reject others’ Influence.</li></ul><h2 id=clearing-conditions>CLEARING CONDITIONS
<a class=anchor href=#clearing-conditions>#</a></h2><p>Some of the basic moves help you clear conditions—comfort or support and
defend, in particular. But the most straightforward way to clear conditions is
to take a particular action to relieve that emotional state. The action varies
depending on the specific condition.</p><p>At the end of any scene in which you take the corresponding action, clear
that condition.</p><ul><li>To clear Angry, hurt someone or break something important.</li><li>To clear Afraid, run from something difficult.</li><li>To clear Guilty, make a sacrifice to absolve your guilt.</li><li>To clear Hopeless, fling yourself into easy relief.</li><li>To clear Insecure, take foolhardy action without talking to your team.</li></ul><p>Clearing Angry requires you to vent your anger, either on someone or on
something. It’s not enough to just punch a bag—you have to take your anger
out on someone, or something important. What’s important is different for
every character, but the GM should ask if and why an object is important
when the Angry character breaks it. Hurting someone doesn’t necessarily mean
hurting them physically—yelling at them and hurting their feelings would do
the trick, too.</p><p>Clearing Afraid requires you to avoid or flee from a complicated, dangerous,
or problematic situation. That could mean anything from running away from a
villain to fleeing the room when someone wants to have a conversation about
your recent actions. The key is avoidance—instead of confronting something,
you’re running from it.</p><p>Clearing Guilty requires you to pay some cost on behalf of others, those
you feel you’ve wronged or let down. It doesn’t require them to actually absolve
you of your guilt—just so long as you pay a price in an attempt to redeem
yourself. This might be anything from standing alone against a dangerous
villain so your teammates can escape to agreeing to follow the older heroes’
rules even when it’s easier not to.</p><p>Clearing Hopeless requires you to seek the easiest and quickest way to
relieve your feelings. Most likely, that means making stupid decisions in pursuit
of stupid fun. It could be anything from finding some cheap booze and getting
drunk to making out with the wrong person.</p><p>Clearing Insecure means following your worst, most impulsive instincts
without consulting anybody first. You feel doubtful of your own abilities, so
you’re proving yourself by following your own plan without talking to anyone
first. That could be anything from deciding to attack the bad guy while the
rest of your team waits in stealth to agreeing to give up the crucial component for the death ray in exchange for escaping right now, all without anyone else’s
input.</p><p>Remember that even if you take the action, you only clear the condition at
the end of the scene. You can clear multiple conditions in one scene, but you
continue to be affected by the penalty for the entirety of the scene</p><h2 id=label-shifting-and-conditions>LABEL SHIFTING AND CONDITIONS
<a class=anchor href=#label-shifting-and-conditions>#</a></h2><p>Shifting a Label means
that your view of yourself is
changing. You see yourself
more as the Label you shift
up, less as the Label you shift
down.</p><p>If you ever need to
shift a Label and can’t
(because the Label is at
+3 and would shift up,
or is at -2 and would
shift down), you must
mark a condition, GM’s
choice. The entire Label
shift doesn’t occur—you
shift no Label either up or
down.</p><blockquote class="book-hint info">Huma’s dad is actually praising him,
telling him that he’s a great hero, the
savior the city needs—but Huma’s Savior
is already at +3. If Huma accepts his dad’s
words, then his Savior would shift up, but it
can’t. Instead, Huma marks a condition—I
tell Rich to mark Insecure, because of all
the pressure his dad is putting on him.</blockquote></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div></footer><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#conditions>CONDITIONS</a><ul><li><a href=#effects-and-marking-conditions>EFFECTS AND MARKING CONDITIONS</a></li><li><a href=#clearing-conditions>CLEARING CONDITIONS</a></li><li><a href=#label-shifting-and-conditions>LABEL SHIFTING AND CONDITIONS</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
