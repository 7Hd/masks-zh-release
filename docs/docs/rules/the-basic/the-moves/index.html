這七個基本動作分別是：〈直面威脅〉、〈釋放你的力量〉、〈保衛某人〉、〈評估局勢〉、〈煽動某人〉、〈安慰或支持某人〉、〈揭穿面具〉。本章將提供這些動作各自的詳細說明、以及他們如何在故事中發揮作用的使用範例。
 直面威脅#當你直接與威脅交戰時，擲+危險。
若成功，你們對彼此造成交互打擊。 擲出10+時，從下列挑選二項。 擲出7-9時，挑選一項。
 抵抗或避開對方的攻擊 奪走他們身上的某物 為你的隊友創造一個機會 讓對手恐懼、吃驚、或留下深刻印象  〈直面威脅〉詳述〈直面威脅〉是一個用來直接與某樣東西──怪物或反派之類──戰鬥的動作。如果你只是伺機打帶跑，希望藉此讓敵人精疲力盡的話，那麼你就不是在直接與威脅交戰，也因此不會觸發這個動作。如果你是在對抗某個對你來說不怎麼危險的人或物，那麼它不會被視作威脅，這個動作也就當然不會被觸發。
「對彼此造成交互打擊」意味著你和威脅都對彼此造成了有效的攻擊。這可能會導致敘事發生變化──除非你的軀體刀槍不入，否則被一頭巨大怪物給打中很可能會讓你傷痕累累。而除了敘事之外的影響，這也通常意味著雙方標記狀態、或是觸發〈承受沉重打擊〉這個動作。
當你與NPC威脅互相造成交互打擊時，GM會標記NPC的其中一個狀態，並要求你為你的角色直接標記一個狀態、或是擲骰進行〈承受沉重打擊〉動作，取決於敘事情境。GM可以自行選擇要為NPC標記哪一個狀態。如果GM要求你進行〈承受沉重打擊〉動作，那麼你只需要遵循這個動作的規則描述來決定接下來發生什麼事就好；如果GM要求你標記一個狀態，那麼他也會接著告訴你該標記哪一個狀態。
當你與PC威脅互相造成交互打擊時，你們雙方都得擲骰進行〈承受沉重打擊〉動作。
關於〈直面威脅〉的選項 抵抗或避開對方的攻擊 意味著你不會受到對方打擊的影響──也許你躲開了威脅的攻擊、或是你滿不在乎的接下了它，看哪種情況對你的角色和威脅來說比較合理。這個選項能確保你毫髮無傷地挺過難關，但不會給你帶來其他好處──這代表你僅僅是擊中了威脅、並很可能只讓他標記了一個狀態而已。
奪走他們身上的某物 意味著你可以從威脅身上奪走某個物理上或概念上的東西。舉例來說，你可以狠揍一拳讓威脅鬆手，打掉他們手上的末日死光槍；或者，你可以奪走他們的立足點讓他們跌倒在地，給你一個絕佳的逃跑機會；又或者，你可以奪走他們的站位，讓他們不再位於超光速粒子大砲的控制面板前方。這個選項給你一個大好機會去透過攻擊來改變敵我局勢。
為你的隊友創造一個機會 意味著你為你的隊友（或者其他盟友）創造出了一個行動的機會、或取得某種優勢。也許你把反派檔在一邊，你的隊友因此有機會衝過去阻截微中子炸彈的啟動。或許你狠狠猛擊惡棍，讓他直直飛向了你在空中的隊友，讓他們有機會接一套漂亮的連續技。無論如何，這個選項都能讓團隊戰術得以實現。
有時候，你會選擇這個選項來改變實際的局勢，讓你的隊友能因此逮到機會去做某個他們原本做不到的事情；而有時候，這個選項就只是為你隊友提供助力。前者的話，選擇這個選項將讓你的隊友獲得採取該行動的機會。若情況為後者，那麼你們將因此獲得一點 團隊默契（參見 團隊默契 章節）。GM會告訴你當時的情境是哪一種。
讓對手恐懼、吃驚、或留下深刻印象 意味著你在交互造成打擊後影響了威脅對你的看法。也許在你展現出如此強大的力量後，他們會突然對你另眼相看；又或許你以一種他們前所未見的方式證明了自己的危險，而他們將因此試圖從你身邊逃離。當你在面對NPC威脅時選擇了這個選項，GM將從這些選項中（恐懼、吃驚、或留下深刻印象）挑選最合理的反應。而無論是NPC或PC，GM可能也會為其標記一個狀態以反映該角色的新看法，只要這個發展符合敘事即可。
〈直面威脅〉的範例 「蠻牛」多羅（由瑪莉莎扮演）在上一次的慘敗後被抓到了這個秘密實驗室，而她現在正嘗試著從中逃脫。在她逃跑的過程中，她遇到了一個跟她極為相似的超人類實驗體；她的克隆體，烏爾莎。烏爾莎露出了殘酷的笑容，讓金屬利爪唰的一聲從她的指尖伸出──這個加強版的能力是多羅所沒有的。瑪莉莎說多羅向旁啐了一口作為回應，並接著舉起雙拳，衝向烏爾莎打算把她狠狠痛揍一番。
在這個情境下，多羅很顯然是在直接與威脅交戰，因此我要求瑪莉莎擲骰進行〈直面威脅〉動作。她擲+危險，並得到了 8 的結果：她和烏爾莎對彼此造成交互打擊，且只能選擇一個選項。瑪莉莎選擇了「奪走烏爾莎身上的某物」──在這個情境下，也就是烏爾莎的金屬利爪。我向瑪莉莎詢問多羅是怎麼做到這件事的，她便描述道多羅抓住了烏爾莎的雙手，將其狠狠砸進牆中，因而折斷了她的利爪。這聽起來很讚！但在這件事發生之前，烏爾莎的金屬利爪會先一步在多羅身上留下幾道可怖的爪痕，而且就連多羅那超級堅硬的肌膚都無法擋下這道爪擊──我要求瑪莉莎為多羅擲骰進行〈承受沉重打擊〉動作，且我給烏爾莎標記了一個狀態（我認為「憤怒」是個很適合的狀態）。
「異變者」雷克斯（由麥特扮演）闖入了征服者的侵攻機獸的操控艙──這頭跟摩天大樓一樣巨大的機器人正在神翠市街道上瘋狂肆虐。雷克斯的視線掃過整個控制艙，裏面滿滿都是征服者的手下，一群實力遠遠不及那位外星大帝的外星雜魚。
「我要衝進去，然後把他們一個個丟飛出去，我需要骰〈直面威脅〉嗎？」麥特問道。
「不用，」我說：「他們不是你的對手，所以不算什麼威脅。你輕而易舉地把他們全都丟飛了出去，並完全癱瘓了侵攻機獸的控制。然而，你也在此時聽見征服者的聲音從控制艙的入口傳來……」
釋放你的力量#當你釋放你的力量克服阻礙、重塑環境、或延展感官時，擲+古怪。
若成功，你成功達成目的。 擲出7-9時，你標記一個狀態、或者ＧＭ會告訴你這股力量是多麼不穩定或僅只造成暫時性的影響。

dangerous, and difficult with your powers. It is definitely not the “use your
powers” move—you’re probably using your abilities on nearly all of the basic
moves. This move is for those situations when you do something intense with
your powers, and we’re not sure how it’ll go, or if you can even pull it off.</p><p>This distinction is crucial—just using your abilities isn’t unleashing them.
Unleashing them means pushing them or using them in dangerous or difficult
situations. Over the course of the game you’ll establish a baseline for each
character that tells you when it feels like they’re unleashing and when they
aren’t. And keep in mind, these characters are all young superheroes, getting
the hang of their powers and what they can do—chances are, they unleash
their powers and push the boundaries of what they can do more often than not.</p><p>If you aren’t trying to overcome an obstacle, reshape your environment,
or extend your senses, then you’re probably not unleashing your powers. That
said, these categories are pretty open-ended. Overcoming an obstacle covers
both flying faster than the villainous Speed Demon to get to the artifact first
and smashing through the sorcerous energy field Gehenna cast to keep you
away from her sanctum. Reshaping your environment covers both bringing
down one wall of the building so you can escape and using your magnetic
powers to trap the villain inside a cage of steel. Extending your senses covers
both extending your telepathy into someone’s mind and using your super-
vision to see halfway across the city.</p><p>Unleash your powers is a bit of an overarching move. When you’re trying
to punch out a titanic rock monster, it feels like you’re unleashing your powers,
namely your tremendous strength&mldr;except, that’s a move to directly engage
a threat. When you’re trying to create a massive ice wall to save your friends
from an explosion, it feels like you’re unleashing your powers&mldr;except, that’s
a move to defend someone from an immediate threat. Always see if another
move fits better and more specifically than unleash your powers before using</p><p>this move—it’s really here for situations where the other moves don’t fit.
If the characters are just using their regular abilities to solve a problem—
running from a threat with no special powers, for example, or trying to drive
a car into an enemy—then it’s not unleashing your powers. The GM just says
what happens based on the fiction. If you want to try to take control over what
happens, use your powers to solve problems!</p><h4 id=關於釋放你的力量的選項>關於〈釋放你的力量〉的選項</h4><p>On a hit, you do it means that as long as you roll 7 or higher, you do the thing
you set out to do, no matter what. But on a 7-9, you have to choose to either
mark a condition (of your choice, not the GM’s), or let the GM tell you how
your effect is unstable or temporary.</p><p>Temporary is pretty self-explanatory—it puts a time pressure on the effect,
and it could be anything from, “You’ve wrapped the villain in a metal cage,
but he’s gonna break out soon, you’ve only bought yourself a bit of time,” to
“You’ve managed to lift up the debris of the collapsed building with your
gravity powers, but you can only hold it up for a bit longer.”</p><p>Unstable is about unintended additional consequences, often dangerous to
you or others. Unstable effects never take away from the core success of the
roll—you still did whatever you intended to do. But they add an additional
element that complicates the situation: collateral damage, unintended
consequence, or worse. The GM might even make you roll to take a powerful

happening. It’s not about preemptively preparing a defense, or setting up a
shield—it’s about preventing the worst in the moment. The threat must be
immediate for this move to trigger.</p><p>NPC threats include threats from the environment—anything the GM
describes or controls. Defending someone from a PC threat is for when a
fellow PC tries to do something bad and you try to stop them. The key isn’t that
you’re defending another PC—it’s that you’re defending against another PC.</p><p>When you trigger this move, be sure that both you and the GM are clear on
what the immediate threat is. You can defend someone from physical dangers
and threats, but you can also defend someone from cruel words or insults—if
an older hero berates your teammate, you can defend them just as much as if
a fireball was hurtling towards their face. In this case, the immediate threat is
the harm and effects of the words.</p><p>You don’t trigger defend someone when you’re trying to keep yourself safe
from an NPC or environmental threat—that’s much more likely to be another
move, like unleashing your powers, or rejecting their Influence. You can defend
yourself from a PC threat when another PC tries to hurt you.</p><p>Keeping them safe means that you prevent the danger you acted against. If
you’re putting up an energy shield to stop someone from getting roasted, then
on a hit, you do that—they’re protected from the flame blast.</p><p>On a 7-9, you must expose yourself to danger or escalate the situation—
your choice. Exposing yourself to danger leaves the danger up to the GM.
It could mean anything from you taking the hit instead of whomever
you’re defending, to your actions leaving you in a more vulnerable position.
Escalating the situation means you make things more tense, more dangerous,
more complicated in general. This is you breaking out your powers to defend
someone when a moment before it was just a verbal fight.</p><p>When you defend against a PC threat, it should always be when the PC is
making a move and they’re really being an overt threat towards you. On a hit,
you give them -2 to their roll, which might shift them down to a 7-9 result or
even a miss. If their move becomes a miss, they still mark potential and the GM
makes a hard move, as usual. They can also still get boosts by other teammates
spending Team out of the pool (page 48).</p><p>Getting a 10+ when defending against a PC threat means you just give
them -2 to their roll at no cost. Getting a 7-9 means you expose yourself to cost,
retribution, or judgment—GM’s choice, based on the situation. Cost means you
pay a price, usually marking a condition yourself, to defend against the other
PC. Retribution means the other PC gets a chance to act against you without
your interference. Judgment means other
people watching might judge
you for your actions, leading
them to shift your Labels
(page 44) or otherwise act
against you.</p><h4 id=關於保衛某人的選項>關於〈保衛某人〉的選項</h4><p>On a hit when defending against
an NPC threat, you always get to

Adding a Team to the pool means your
actions now are building up a sense of
team cohesion and focus that you can
call on later.</p><p>Taking Influence over someone
you protect means they care about
how you’ve helped them, and
they’re more inclined to listen to
you moving forward. If you already
had Influence over an NPC, there’s
little reason to take Influence over them
again—you’ll get +1 forward on your
next move aimed at them, but that’s it.</p><p>However, taking Influence over a PC
you already hold it over allows you to
immediately shift their Labels. When
you protect a whole bunch of people,
you can either: name the specific
person in the crowd that you want
Influence over; let the GM tell you someone important in the crowd over
whom you now have Influence; or take Influence over a whole group.</p><p>Clearing a condition means you can immediately clear a condition you have

Vanquish? Ask “What here can I use to trap Vanquish?” and the GM will tell
you. The answer might be “nothing.”</p><p>“What here is the biggest threat?” helps you to prioritize dangers and threats
in the area. You can clarify to the GM how you prioritize things yourself—so
the GM knows whether you’d think that the biggest threat is an enemy or
something that endangers civilians, for instance. It’s also useful even when
you’re not in an immediately dangerous situation to find out who’s the most
menacing in the room.</p><p>“What here is in the greatest danger?” is the inverse of the prior question.

you want. This isn’t just straight up manipulation, though—provoking someone
isn’t about trying to convince them to do it, or offering them something they
want. It’s about pushing the right buttons to get them to do what you want.
Your words don’t have to match your intent, so long as you’re pressing the
right buttons.</p><p>You can only provoke someone susceptible to your words. If you have
Influence over someone, they are, by default, susceptible to your words, but
otherwise it’s down to what makes sense. Sometimes you’re able to say the right
thing to get to someone, especially if you’ve already pierced their mask (page
73). But other times, they can shrug off your words—for example, Rampage,
a dangerous and powerful monster, might not be susceptible to your threats of
violence. But if you prod and taunt her about her transformed, inhuman form,
she might be susceptible to those words.</p><p>When you provoke someone, tell the GM what you’re trying to get them to
do. This is crucial! What you say in character to provoke them is about pushing
their buttons—but what you actually want them to do might be totally different
from what you say out loud. You might provoke an adult hero, pushing them,
getting in their face, as if you were provoking them to a violent confrontation.
Except you really want them to back down and leave, and you’re counting on
them being an adult and a hero to get them to do what you actually want. Every
time you provoke someone, you must say exactly what you want them to do
out of character, no matter what you’re saying in character.</p><p>When an NPC “rises to the bait and does what you want,” it means they do
whatever you said you wanted them to do out of character. If you wanted them
to back down, they do. If you wanted them to come after you and ignore your
teammates, they do. On a 7-9 result for NPCs, they can still choose to rise to
the bait and do what you want, or they can instead choose one of
the options from the list.</p><h4 id=關於煽動某人的選項>關於〈煽動某人〉的選項</h4><p>If the NPC stumbles, it means they were tripped up, caught on something,
knocked off balance by your words. They’re ill-prepared to deal with your next
move; hence, you get +1 forward against them. Stumbling is essentially non-
action, allowing you to follow-up with a more straightforward move against
them, at an advantage.</p><p>If the NPC errs, it means they take action without planning or thinking
and it leaves them vulnerable or creates an opportunity that you wouldn’t
have otherwise had. They might take a swing at you, leaving them open for
you to simply knock them out with one punch. They might accidentally let
information slip in an attempt to tell you off.</p><p>If the NPC overreacts, it means you take Influence over them, and they take
an exaggerated or extreme reaction in response to what you say, something
that shows you’ve really gotten to them. This isn’t the same as erring—their
overreaction might not give you any kind of opportunity or even a chance to
react. Instead, it shows how much your words actually affected them. They
might start firing their eyebeams at you in response to your taunting. They
might lose their composure and start insulting you directly.</p><p>If you’re trying to provoke a PC, on a 7-9, you pick that either they must
mark a condition if they don’t do what you said you wanted them to do out
of character, or you can add a Team to the pool if they do what you want. On
a 10+, both are true. If they must mark a condition, they get to choose which
condition they mark.</p><h4 id=煽動某人的範例>〈煽動某人〉的範例</h4><blockquote class="book-hint info"><p>The Dread Queen is flying in her quantum skyship, chasing Skysong over the skies of

up to you.</p><h4 id=關於安慰或支持某人的選項>關於〈安慰或支持某人〉的選項</h4><p>On a hit, the person you are comforting or supporting has to
decide if they want to open up to you. What that means varies
heavily depending on the specific situation—it could cover

their player must answer honestly. For NPCs, that means the GM answers
honestly. You should ask all your questions at once, but if you must, you can
hold questions for as long as you’re watching them.</p><h4 id=關於揭穿面具的選項>關於〈揭穿面具〉的選項</h4><p>“What are you really planning?” is about long term plans. It’s about overarching
goals and intent, not immediate intent. The answer could be “Nothing,” but
most characters have some kind of overarching goal and plan that they can
use to answer the question.</p><p>“What do you want me to do?” puts a focus on the other person’s vision and
ideas for you and how they want you to act. You can usually offer to act how
they want in exchange for getting something from them.</p><p>“What do you intend to do?” is about immediate plans, right here in the
moment. It’s a very action-focused question, giving you information on what
you can expect to happen very soon.</p><p>“How could I get your character to ___?” is one of your best ways to
get other characters to do what you want in the game. You fill in the blank
with whatever action you want them to take. They have to answer honestly,
so whatever action or events they describe will genuinely get them to take
the actions they’ve promised. The answer might be “You can’t,” because the
question and what it’s asking of them is so not in character, they just wouldn’t
do what you want them to.</p><p>“How could I gain Influence over you?” is one of the most straightforward
ways of getting Influence on someone. If you already have Influence over
them, the question won’t tell you anything; if you don’t, this tells you what you
need to do to ensure that your words and opinions matter to them. If you do
whatever they tell you to do, they should grant you Influence immediately after.</p><h4 id=揭穿面具的範例>〈揭穿面具〉的範例</h4><blockquote class="book-hint info"><p>Skysong is talking to Agent Coriolis of A.E.G.I.S. Coriolis wants Skysong to hand

see it in her eyes, the veiled excitement and greed—she wants to get her hands on
your ship so she can take it apart and learn its technologies,” I say. “What do you do?”</p></blockquote><blockquote class="book-hint info"><p>The Scarlet Songbird is trying to waltz out of a bank with a few bags of cash, and Rex

out what’s going on, before I decide to punch him.”</p><p>Matt rolls an 11. His first question: “What do you intend to do?”</p><p>“He’s way cockier than he should be. He intends to get out of here with the cash,
sure, but more importantly he intends to show off by taking you down. He must think
he has some way to do that, nice and easy.”</p><p>“Yeah, that’s not going to happen. How could I gain Influence over him? It’d be
useful for stopping him,” asks Matt.</p><p>“Compliment him! Play into his arrogance and ego, and he’ll start listening.
Praise this clever plan of his,” I say.</p><p>“Ugh. I really, really don’t want to do that.”</p><p>“Well, he’s walking past you now, so what do you do?”</p></blockquote></div></details><br><div class=Move><h2 id=承受沉重打擊>承受沉重打擊

You’ll never
trigger this one intentionally. The GM always tells you when you need to
roll it. Most likely, you’ll get smacked during a fight—often as a result of a
directly engage—and the GM will tell you to take a powerful blow to see what
happens. You can take a powerful blow on an emotional level, too—getting
punched with a deep and terrible truth, maybe, or hearing someone you care
about utterly rip your heart to shreds.</p><p>Rolling + conditions marked means that you count up however many
conditions you have marked, and add that number to your roll. Remember,
you can’t roll with higher than +4. If you have zero conditions marked, then
you roll +0.</p><h4 id=關於承受沉重打擊的選項>關於〈承受沉重打擊〉的選項</h4><p>You must remove yourself from the situation means you’re out. You’re knocked
from the scene somehow. You get ultimate say in how exactly you’re removed,
but you should follow the fiction. If you just got punched in the face, you
probably got knocked out. You’ll come back next scene, but all your conditions
will still be marked.</p><p>You lose control of yourself or your powers in a terrible way means the GM
gets to tell you how your powers go haywire, cause collateral damage, make
the world around you unstable, and all kinds of other bad stuff. Losing control
of yourself means that you might say or do something awful. The GM chooses
which you do, and what exactly that looks like.</p><p>Lashing out verbally means you’re thrown off your game, and you release
the tension by snapping at someone you care about, usually another teammate.
You have to immediately provoke them to take a foolhardy action, or you
have to take advantage of your Influence over them to inflict a condition—any
condition. Those are the only actions that satisfy “lashing out verbally.”</p><p>Giving ground means you retreat, or hold back, or otherwise leave an
opening for your opposition. The GM decides what it is, but usually it means
your opposition can make some move they otherwise would’ve been blocked
from, without you being able to stop them.</p><p>Struggling past the pain means you mark two conditions of your choice.
You hurt, but you keep going.</p><p>When you stand strong, you mark potential (just like on any miss), and you
get to say exactly how you manage to weather or avoid the blow.</p><h4 id=承受沉重打擊的範例>〈承受沉重打擊〉的範例</h4><blockquote class="book-hint info"><p>Toro’s tussling with the robotic-bodied Shell, the two powerhouses punching it out
head-on. Marissa rolls to directly engage a threat and gets an 8, ultimately choosing
to take something from Shell—in this case, her weapons. But that means they trade
blows, so Shell gets a hit in on Toro before Toro rips off Shell’s gun arms.</p><p>“Toro, you’re in close with Shell, so she’s having a hard time bringing her cannon-
arms to bear, which is good for you—you may be tough, but those things hurt. You
see an opening, but it leaves you open too. You manage to sweep past one of her
punches to get in close and latch your hands onto her elbows, but she gets a good
shot at your sides with her guns, before you rip off either end of her arms, wires and
sparks spewing out of the broken limbs. Take a powerful blow for her shots,” I say
to Marissa.</p><p>“I’ve got Angry marked, so I’m rolling +1,” says Marissa. She rolls, and gets
a miss—a good thing on this move! She gets to mark potential and say how she
weathers the blow.</p><p>“Oh, it hurts, a ton,” says Marissa. “But I just stand there and take it, relying on my
invulnerability and focusing on my goals. She’s not going to stop me.”</p></blockquote><blockquote class="book-hint info"><p>Dusk and Vertex are facing Lady Faust, Dusk’s nemesis and ancestor, in a standoff,
circling each other.</p><p>“I want to provoke her into revealing a secret—telling me why she’s here,” says
Grace. “‘If you’re so powerful, why all the subtlety? Are you worried I’ll stop you?’”</p><p>“Cool!” I say. “Go ahead and roll.” Grace gets snake eyes!</p><p>“Oh yeah, she looks at you with a feral grin. ‘Oh, you poor child,’ she says. ‘I
wouldn’t want to burden you further. After all that you’ve been through, all that
you’ve done to those around you&mldr;all the suffering you caused to your parents.’ Her
grin grows wider. ‘You did know, didn’t you? That your status as the portal to another
realm caused your mother to go mad?’”</p><p>“Oh, man,” says Grace. “I did not know that. Oh, man.”</p><p>“Yep,” I say. “I think that means you take a powerful blow. The revelation hits
you hard.” Grace rolls to take a powerful blow. Fortunately, she didn’t have any
conditions marked, so she rolls +0 and gets an 8.</p><p>“I choose to lash out at a teammate. Vertex maybe makes a movement, to come
closer to me, and I turn and snap at him—’Get away from me! Get back! Get out of
here!’ I’m provoking him to leave me alone with Lady Faust.”</p></blockquote></div></details></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div></footer><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#基本動作>基本動作</a><ul><li><a href=#直面威脅>直面威脅</a></li><li><a href=#釋放你的力量>釋放你的力量</a></li><li><a href=#保衛某人>保衛某人</a></li><li><a href=#評估局勢>評估局勢</a></li><li><a href=#煽動某人>煽動某人</a></li><li><a href=#安慰或支持某人>安慰或支持某人</a></li><li><a href=#揭穿面具>揭穿面具</a></li><li><a href=#承受沉重打擊>承受沉重打擊</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
