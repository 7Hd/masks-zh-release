<a class=anchor href=#team>#</a></h1><p>Team is a resource that the team of young superheroes can use to help each
other out. It represents their unity, their connection, and their coordination,
but it’s pretty intangible—a squad of superheroes with a lot of Team doesn’t
look different, but they’re much more prepared to work together!</p><h2 id=using-team>USING TEAM
<a class=anchor href=#using-team>#</a></h2><p>Anyone on the team can spend a Team out of the pool to give a teammate
+1 on a move, after the roll. To do this, the spender has to be able to actually
help—if you’re in a completely different place from your teammate, then you
can’t spend Team to help, unless it makes sense in the fiction (a telepathic
connection, maybe).</p><p>Multiple teammates can spend Team from the pool to help on the same
roll—even low rolls can be turned into hits when the whole group pitches in
and there’s enough Team in the pool. But each teammate can only spend one
Team out of the pool for any single roll, and they still have to be able to actually
help in the fiction</p><blockquote class="book-hint info"><p>Toro charges at Blood Opal, and the two start fighting hand to hand, Blood Opal
striking with her sword and Toro punching with her fists. Marissa rolls for Toro to
directly engage a threat, and gets 5 total—a miss.</p><p>“I want to help,” says Grace. “I summon up a brief shadow construct, just
something to grab her ankle and throw her off balance.”</p><p>“I’m not sure you can help,” I say. “You’re stuck on the other end of the street
fighting against Aquaria, aren’t you? You’ve got your hands full.”</p><p>“What about me?” says Mark. “Sureshot can fire an arrow into the conflict so
Blood Opal has to deflect it at just the right moment.”</p><p>“Yeah, that’s great! You were just firing arrows from on top of the nearby building,
you can definitely help like that. Spend a Team out of the pool.”
That raises Marissa’s roll to a 6. But it’s still a miss.</p><p>“Am I there yet? Have I arrived?” asks Sarah. “I’ve been flying there as fast as I
can.”</p><p>“Oh yeah, you’re there now.”</p><p>“Awesome! I fly straight at Blood Opal from the opposite direction of Sureshot’s
arrow. This’ll help keep her off balance so Toro can get that perfect hit.”</p><p>“Excellent! Spend another Team out of the pool, Sarah.” Now Marissa’s roll is
7—a hit!</p></blockquote><p>NPCs who are part of the team, whether temporarily or permanently, can
also help. Players can spend Team from the pool on behalf of those NPCs. The
players still have to spend one Team per NPC who helps, and the NPCs still
have to be fictionally capable of helping. If the GM thinks the NPC wouldn’t
help, then they won’t.</p><h2 id=spending-team-selfishly>SPENDING TEAM SELFISHLY
<a class=anchor href=#spending-team-selfishly>#</a></h2><p>PC team members can also spend Team to act selfishly.</p><div class=Move><p>When you act selfishly, say how your actions ignore or insult your teammates, remove
one Team from the pool, and shift one Label up and one Label down, your choice. You can
use this option after rolling to alter the Label you’re rolling with.</p></div><p>Because you can act selfishly after you roll, this can boost a miss up to a hit,
or a partial hit up to a full hit, by changing the Label you rolled with. All you
have to do is spend the Team from the pool and describe your character doing
something that ignores or insults your teammates.</p><p>Generally, your teammates can determine whether they feel ignored or
insulted by the selfish action, but the GM can push on it if it seems appropriate.
Acting selfishly may save you when you can’t be helped by anybody else, but
it has a cost you can’t avoid.</p><blockquote class="book-hint info"><p>Vertex is unleashing his powers to create illusions, to try to distract Arcknife from
attacking him. He’s on his own, too; no teammates around to help. He rolls, and he
gets a 6&mldr;not enough for a hit.</p><p>“Crud! And no one can help?” Jack asks.</p><p>“Nope. What do you do?”</p><p>“Y’know what? I’m going to make the illusions look exactly like my teammates.
I’m going to have them taunt him, so he’ll chase after them, and then once he sees
the real ones, he’ll leave me alone,” says Jack. “I’m acting selfishly, spending a Team
out of the pool to shift my Freak up and my Savior down, so I get that extra +1 I
need for a hit.”</p><p>“What do you think? Is that selfish enough? Do you feel insulted or ignored?” I
ask the other teammates.</p><p>“Definitely,” says Marissa. “You jerk.”</p><p>I have Jack spend the Team and shift his Labels.</p></blockquote><h2 id=adding-team-to-the-pool>ADDING TEAM TO THE POOL
<a class=anchor href=#adding-team-to-the-pool>#</a></h2><p>The primary way to generate Team in the pool is by entering battle against a
dangerous foe as a team.</p><div class=Move><p>When you enter battle against a dangerous foe as a team, add two to the
Team pool.</p><ul><li>If the leader has Influence over every teammate, add another Team.</li><li>If everyone has the same purpose in the fight, add another Team.</li><li>If any team member mistrusts the leader or the team, remove a Team.</li><li>If your team is ill-prepared or off-balance, remove a Team.</li></ul><p>The leader of the team can mark a condition to avoid removing a Team from the pool.</p></div><p>Entering battle against a dangerous foe as
a team is the moment when the team’s about to
start fighting. You can think of it as the pose right
before the fight; the moment when the team
comes up with a plan, right before they start
the punching; or the very split second foes
burst in, and the team starts to react.</p><p>If someone’s alone, they can’t trigger
this move—they’re not entering battle
as a team. If the team isn’t actually
going up against a dangerous foe, they
can’t trigger this move. “Dangerous foe”
should be interpreted liberally; going
up against a horrible monster or a giant
meteor can both trigger this move.</p><p>When you trigger this move, the GM
asks the team who the leader is. If there’s
dissent, the GM makes the final call, but that’s
a good sign that team members might
mistrust the leader or the team.</p><p>Then run through each criterion on
the move. “Teammates” are anyone on
the team who might be able to spend
Team out of the pool to help—so if the
leader doesn’t have Influence over all
those characters, then they don’t get the
extra Team in the pool for that criterion.</p><p>To determine if everyone has the same purpose in the fight, the GM asks
the leader what their purpose in the fight is, and then every other teammate
gets to say if they share the same purpose. Mild variation is fine—the difference
between “Beat the bad guys” and “Beat Vortex” is negligible. But the difference
between “Beat Vortex” and “Save my mom” is significant and means that the
team doesn’t get the extra Team in the pool for that criterion.</p><p>Every team member gets to say whether they mistrust the leader or the
team—that’s their decision, but the GM can ask clarifying questions.</p><p>The GM is the final arbiter of whether the team is ill-prepared or offbalance, and it’s based entirely on the fiction. If the team is at all expecting this
fight, there’s a good chance they aren’t ill-prepared or off-balance; then again, if
the team is in the midst of plenty of internal conflicts, or they’re missing a clear
understanding of their foes’ intent or abilities, then they might be ill-prepared
or off-balance, even if they know the fight is coming.</p><blockquote class="book-hint info"><p>The team of Grasshopper, Hornet, Huma, and Skysong is flying on Skysong’s
crystalline ship—they’re going to try to free Sureshot from Brass Brilliant’s clutches.
But Brass is holding Sureshot in an underground base with plenty of goons there.
When they leave the ship, they have a moment where they share a look, and consult
one last time on what the plan is. Huma tells everyone the plan is to go in quietly.</p><p>“Okay, great! It sounds to me like you’re entering battle against a dangerous foe
as a team. So. Who’s your leader?” I ask.</p><p>“Well, Hornet, normally,” says Joe. “But I think it’s Huma in this case.”</p><p>“Agreed. Okay, so first you add two Team to the pool. Then, if the leader has
Influence over everyone on the Team, you add another.”</p><p>“I don’t. This is why I shouldn’t be the leader!” says Rich.</p><p>“Heh. Next criterion—does everybody have the same purpose? Huma, what’s
your purpose in the fight?”</p><p>“I’m here to free Sureshot, first and foremost,” says Rich.</p><p>“Is that everybody’s purpose?” I ask.
Joe shakes his head. “Nope, my purpose is to take down Brass Brilliant.”</p><p>“Okay then, no extra Team for that criterion. Does anybody mistrust the leader
or the team? Skysong? Hornet?”</p><p>“Nah,” says Andrea. “I don’t mistrust Huma, I just don’t particularly listen to him.”</p><p>“Cool. And finally, I don’t think you’re off-balance or ill-prepared—you know
what you’re getting into. So that’s it! You stand outside the doors to the underground
base. What do you do?”</p></blockquote><p>The Team pool can reset when you shift the fiction forward some significant
period of time.</p><div class=Move>Whenever time passes, the GM empties the Team pool and restores it to one Team.</div><p>“Time passing” isn’t about some specific amount of time going by. It’s
about a fictional reset, like when there’s a time jump to leap ahead in the story,
creating a clear divide in the story. It’s when a TV show episode ends and the
next one picks up weeks later, or when a comic book has the little narrative
bubble saying “One month later…” Time passing naturally over the course of
play won’t trigger this move—the GM doesn’t simply empty the Team pool
because things move forward.</p><p>Essentially, if you ever come to the close of events and shift them forward
(most likely by a week or more) to get to the next exciting thing, then the GM
resets the Team pool to one.</p><h1 id=playbook-team-moves>PLAYBOOK TEAM MOVES
<a class=anchor href=#playbook-team-moves>#</a></h1><p>Each playbook has two moves listed under the section “Team Moves.” These
are always based on the same two triggers: When you share a triumphant
celebration with someone and When you share a weakness or vulnerability
with someone. The specifics of what happens after the trigger vary with each
playbook.</p><p>These moves demonstrate how your playbook leads you to connect to and
engage with other people in moments of high drama. You’ll probably use them
most often with teammates, although they trigger regardless of whom you
share the moment with. When you trigger either one, even though multiple
people might technically be in the room, you have to choose who in particular
you’re most sharing with.</p><p>Sharing a triumphant celebration should be more than just high-fives
after the fight. The idea is that you’re excited, you’re happy, and you’re inviting
someone to share in your happiness and joy in the moment. It could be a
meaningful hug or kiss, a congratulatory set of compliments, or a shared party
or drink.</p><p>Sharing a weakness or vulnerability is letting someone else see the most
secret and vulnerable parts of yourself. You’re telling someone your worst fears
or memories, your deepest desires, your greatest insecurities. You could show
it to them, or you could tell them—either way, so long as you’re sharing it, the
move triggers.</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div></footer><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#team>TEAM</a><ul><li><a href=#using-team>USING TEAM</a></li><li><a href=#spending-team-selfishly>SPENDING TEAM SELFISHLY</a></li><li><a href=#adding-team-to-the-pool>ADDING TEAM TO THE POOL</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#playbook-team-moves>PLAYBOOK TEAM MOVES</a></li></ul></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
