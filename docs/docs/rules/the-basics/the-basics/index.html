<a class=anchor href=#the-conversation>#</a></h2><p>Playing MASKS is having a conversation. That means it’s easy! You sit at the table
with dice and pencils and sheets of paper, and you talk with each other. For
the most part, the conversation revolves around your characters. You say what
they do and how they react. Since the other players don’t live in your head, you
convey your character’s thoughts, emotions, and feelings to the other players
and the GM.</p><p>There are times in the conversation when you slip directly into your
character’s shoes, no longer narrating but actually taking on your character’s
persona. You make the gestures your character makes; you say things your
character says. Most people do this without thinking much about it. It’s pretty
natural to become your character while you’re playing, to want what they want,
to fear the outcome of the dice at crucial moments.</p><p>The conversation in a roleplaying game evolves naturally over the course
of the session. But it’s your job as a group to keep the conversation interesting.
The rules, the techniques, and everything you bring to the table is about driving
that conversation toward interesting places. Explosive fights! Emotional
confessions! Heroic sacrifices! Wherever the fiction takes you.</p><h2 id=framing-scenes>FRAMING SCENES
<a class=anchor href=#framing-scenes>#</a></h2><p>The best way to keep the conversation moving toward interesting places is
to frame scenes. Instead of sitting around the table talking vaguely about
cool characters, who they are, and what they can do, put those characters into
concrete locations with concrete objectives. You don’t just say, “Oh yeah, Nano’s
got nanite powers, so he can make weapons out of the nanites in his body!”
You put Nano into the Exemplars’ Headquarters and describe him sending his
nanites into the nearby machines and taking over the security system.</p><p>Think about your story like a comic book or superhero movie. Cut straight
to dramatic struggles against dangerous villains or complicated discussions
about what’s right or wrong in a difficult situation. Skip the boring stuff and
get right to the meat of what’s happening or what’s about to happen. It sounds
complicated, but it’s no harder than starting any conversation; once you get up
and running, the rules of the game will take you the rest of the way. The GM
has final call on what happens when, but it’s the responsibility of everyone in
the group to ensure that every scene in your story starts out interesting and
goes somewhere meaningful.</p><h3 id=hard-framing>HARD FRAMING
<a class=anchor href=#hard-framing>#</a></h3><p>Sometimes the GM wants to move things along faster or jump right into a
tense or difficult situation. Maybe the consequences of an earlier decision
come to bear, hard and fast—it’s time for the dragon creature you accidentally
unleashed from an extradimensional portal to make its appearance again, or
your teammate’s Mom has had enough of your teenage hijinks. The GM tells
you what’s happening and it’s your job to react!</p><p>This technique is <strong>hard scene framing</strong>, so-called because there’s less
room for negotiation; the scene starts and the PCs must react as best they can.
Despite the tropes, villains often don’t give heroes a chance to plan before they
begin their dastardly plans.</p><blockquote class="book-hint info"><p>Joe’s character, Hornet the Protégé, is trained by Mantis, a skilled and capable hero
from the Silver Generation. Hornet was relatively unscathed by the dressing down
with the Gentleman, so I decide that Hornet’s story needs a strong push. They aren’t
MASKS characters if they aren’t getting pushed around.</p><p>“So Hornet, where’re you headed after the meeting at the team base? Check in
with Mantis? You haven’t talked to her since the fight,” I ask.</p><p>“Yeah, I’d go talk to her. I need to know what she thinks about finding those kids
we fought,” Joe replies.</p><p>“Awesome. So you’re arriving at the secret teleportal she set up for you, the one
hidden in the alleyway, right? And it’s not camouflaged like it should be. The portal
looks damaged. Through the faint image you see in the archway, you see sparking
control consoles. Looks like somebody wrenched the portal open and forced their
way through. What do you do?”</p></blockquote><h3 id=what-do-you-do>“WHAT DO YOU DO?”
<a class=anchor href=#what-do-you-do>#</a></h3><p>“What do you do?” is a constant refrain of MASKS. Halcyon City moves quickly,
and there isn’t time for you to construct detailed plans when space insects start
pouring out of another portal over on 5th and Main. Scene framing is about
getting characters to the question “What do you do?” as quickly as possible.
Hard scene framing makes the question immediate and demanding, so the
characters have to answer it right away.</p><p>Generally, MASKS is about dramatic doing. Scenes where the characters jaw
about past boyfriends or girlfriends, or make complex plans to deal with the
dangerous superhuman threats might interest you, but the game is ultimately
about making decisions quickly and acting on impulse. It’s about action, even
if that action is dramatic and intense conversation. That doesn’t mean you
never have those contemplative moments, but understand they’re few and far
between amid all the action and drama. Halcyon City moves fast!</p><h3 id=following-the-fiction>FOLLOWING THE FICTION
<a class=anchor href=#following-the-fiction>#</a></h3><p>Superhero comics in particular have a long history of “the retcon” (short for
retroactive continuity), a technique by which some prior truth in the fiction
is undone or changed. That character didn’t really die in that explosion—that
was an alien clone! The real character was in a stasis pod aboard the mothership ,
says the retcon.</p><p>A good retcon respects what was established as true, and makes sense
within that set of facts. A bad retcon ignores what was previously true in the
fiction, and twists the circumstances to ensure a particular outcome.</p><p>MASKS (like many superhero stories) falls apart if you retcon without regard
to the fiction that’s come before. When you say something in the conversation
of MASKS, it becomes true, and what comes later needs to build on that. Hold
yourself to what you establish, and the game will reward your discipline.</p><blockquote class="book-hint info"><p>“Ah, crud,” says Joe. “I dash through the portal, but stay low behind control consoles.
If someone’s there, I don’t want them to see me.”</p><p>“Awesome!” I reply. This is a golden opportunity because Hornet’s headed into
danger alone. “You go through the portal, and on the other side you immediately hear
a weird buzzing sound, and then a voice from somewhere in the control room: ‘I’ve
been waiting for you, girl.’ It’s weirdly electronic, and familiar—you’re pretty sure it’s
Technatrix, one of Mantis’s old foes.”</p><p>“Oh, man, I remember her. No way I’m gonna win against her, I probably
shouldn’t go in.”</p><p>“Too late. You’re through the portal already, and you hear a snap-hiss sound as
it shuts down behind you.”</p><p>“What?! How’d she do that?!”</p><p>Like I said, golden opportunity. I’m following the previously established fiction
to reveal a horrible truth to Hornet. “You can almost hear her grin in her bizarre
voice. ‘Remember when someone stole data from Mantis’s cores? You were so worried
that something was taken out or deleted, you didn’t look for anything left inside the
system.’”</p><p>“Ah, crud!”</p></blockquote><p>In the example, we adhere to the fiction on two sides. I hold myself to the
fiction, establishing how Technatrix got in here, and I keep Joe to the fiction,
ensuring that Hornet’s held to her actions in a reasonable way.</p><p>I’m trying to keep true to the fiction—no one had established that
Technatrix left a code bomb in Mantis’s data cores, but we never established
who accessed them in a previous session. If we had—for example, if Hornet
had learned that Source Code had accessed Mantis’s data cores—then I’d
disregard that fiction if I said it was actually Technatrix all along.</p><p>On the other side, Hornet took action that ended poorly for her that she
couldn’t take back—but that’s perfect! When you play Masks, you dive into
ambushes you didn’t know were there, or you say things you didn’t realize
would be hurtful, or you use your powers in ways that have unexpected side
effects. You take actions that have consequences, and that’s exactly what you
want. You can’t take back those actions, much as you might want to, and the
group must keep everybody honest about sticking to what’s actually happened.</p><p>Wanting to clarify, detail, or hone an action is just fine. If Joe had said, “I
dash through the portal,” I might have asked, “You just charge in stun batons
blazing?” And Joe could’ve replied, “No, I want to stay low and hidden.” That
kind of clarification and definition is perfectly appropriate, but none of it
undoes something that happened. Stick to the truths you’ve established.</p><h3 id=moves-and-dice>MOVES AND DICE
<a class=anchor href=#moves-and-dice>#</a></h3><p>Framing scenes starts the conversation in an interesting place, like nocking
an arrow on the bow and aiming it at a target. But the moves carry the arrow
to the target. They connect your characters to the fiction in exciting ways,
and they drive the story in directions you might not expect. Each move is a
small set of rules that help resolve conflicts, answer questions in the fiction,
and push the story forward. Moves are like the programming language of the
game—“When you do x, then y”—shaping and defining the fiction when your
characters take action.</p><p>The basic moves are the core of the game, and any PC can trigger them
from the start of play. Each character also gets their own playbook moves,
more specific pieces of programming language that point the characters in
their own cool and interesting directions. The PCs might add more moves over
the course of play, too. In general, the basic moves cover situations that come
up all the time in MASKS stories, while the special moves cover situations that
are character specific or much more rare.</p><p>Every move has a specific trigger, the “When you do x” part of the program.
They aren’t triggered whenever, or when you feel like they should be, but only
when your characters are in situations that trigger the move. If you want to
trigger a move, you have to do the thing that triggers it. (You can also avoid
a move by avoiding its trigger.) Triggers are almost always tied to the fiction,
which means all moves are governed by the same principle: if you do it, you do
it. If you want to trigger the basic move directly engage a threat, then you have
to directly engage a threat, perhaps charging at a supervillain while screaming
and swinging your fists. And if you pick up a car in each hand and go swinging
at the giant robot, you’re directly engaging the threat, and the move triggers,
whether you like it or not.</p><blockquote class="book-hint info"><p>Marissa’s character, Toro the Bull, is in a super-science lab—like the kind that
experimented on her—and she’s not happy about it.</p><p>“You recognize the gene vats, the nano-machines, all the equipment, Toro,” I say.
“It’s weirdly like coming home. And there are people, teenagers like you, floating in
those gene vats on the far side of the room. The scientists in the room look at you,
aghast.”</p><p>“Oh hell no,” Marissa says. “I start flinging tables over, chucking them around like
crazy. I want this place messed up.”</p><p>I nod. Toro isn’t triggering a move yet; she’s super strong, so flipping these tables
isn’t exactly difficult for her, and she’s unthreatened. “Yeah, you make a mess. Tables
up-ended, chemicals spilled, scientists running from you. This room is trashed. That’s
when a whole squad of black-armored thugs with assault rifles comes into the room.
They don’t even look like they’re going to ask you to surrender, they’re just going to
shoot.”</p><p>Marissa grins at me. “Awesome. I wade into their midst and start tossing them
around.”</p><p>I nod. “Perfect. You’re directly engaging a threat, definitely.”</p><p>Marissa makes a face. “Oof, hold up, I didn’t think these guys were an actual
danger. I’m bulletproof, right?”</p><p>“Yeah, but they’re well-trained and pouring concentrated fire your way. They’re
pretty dangerous, even to you. Still want to wade in and toss ’em around?”</p><p>Marissa has time to reconsider and not take the action—she hasn’t crossed the
Rubicon yet, hasn’t seen the consequences of the action.</p><p>“Yeah,” she says. “Let’s go for it.”</p><p>Marissa looks to the basic move—directly engage a threat—to find out what
happens next.</p></blockquote><p>Often when you trigger a move, you roll dice to see what happens next.
These are the only times you roll dice in the whole game. You might want
to roll dice to resolve a situation at other times—don’t, until you’ve actually
done something in the game that triggers a move. Sometimes you might want
to trigger a move and go straight to rolling without describing any action in
the fiction—don’t, until you’ve done something in the game that triggers it.
Fiction first.</p><p>Some moves are just input-output without any random element. No dice
needed. See New Examplar on page 199 for an example of a move that doesn’t
need dice.</p><h3 id=hits-and-misses>HITS AND MISSES
<a class=anchor href=#hits-and-misses>#</a></h3><p>When a move asks you to roll dice, pick up two six-sided dice (hereafter
referred to as 2d6) and roll them. You’ll probably be asked to roll with
something or “+” something, like Freak, Danger, Savior, or Conditions Marked.
That means add that number to whatever comes up on the 2d6. So if you have
Danger +3, you add 3 to the results on the dice. If you have Savior -2, you
subtract 2 from the results on the dice.</p><p>You can never roll with more than +4, and less than -3, no matter what
penalties or bonuses you’d have.</p><p>Every move splits up outcomes the same way. A 7 or higher is a “hit,” while
a 6 or less is a “miss.” A 10 or higher is a “strong hit,” while a 7, 8, or 9 is a “weak
hit.” Most moves give some results and changes to the fiction between strong
hits and weak hits, and some may say what happens on a miss. Follow what
the move says when you roll it.</p><p>In general, a hit means you largely keep control of the situation and
probably get some version of what you want. It’s not always exactly or all that
you wanted, but it’s the bare minimum. On a weak hit (7-9), you might get
a distorted version of what you wanted, or you might get some major costs
attached. On a strong hit (10 or higher), you might get an even better version
of what you wanted. You almost always want 10+ when you roll (except for
the one inverted move in the game, take a powerful blow—pay close attention
to that one!).</p><p>A miss, 6 or less, isn’t the same as a failure. It just means the GM gets full
say over what happens next, and chances are you won’t like it. The GM will
probably make things worse for you in some way, tighten the screws more, but
it doesn’t have to be the worst possible thing that could happen, and it doesn’t
even have to mean that you actually failed. Some of the most interesting misses
give you exactly what you wanted, in the worst possible way.</p><blockquote class="book-hint info"><p>Marissa rolls to toss those black-clad goons around, and sadly rolls 2, with Danger
+2, for a total of 4. A miss.</p><p>“Yeah, you’re thrown into the mix with them, and they’re pumping bullets your
way, but you largely shrug them off as you chuck these soldier types around, sending
them flying into tables and walls with abandon. When you hurl the last one all the
way up against the ceiling and watch them fall back down, you notice their features
underneath the cracked helmet. This guy’s a teenager. You peel off the helmet and
find a guy no older than you, but with implants in his skin, probably something
ensuring his compliance. Each one you check is the same, another teen, showing
signs of experimentation. You just beat up your lab-siblings, the same people you
were hoping to save.”</p><p>Marissa groans. “Oof. Now I feel terrible.”</p></blockquote><p>The GM doesn’t roll dice in MASKS, ever. The GM just says what happens,
making moves when a player rolls a miss, when the conversation gets boring,
or when a move tells them to contribute. These limits ensure the GM sets up
situations in which the PCs are forced to react. For more about GM moves,
check out page 135.</p><h3 id=triggers-and-uncertainty>TRIGGERS AND UNCERTAINTY
<a class=anchor href=#triggers-and-uncertainty>#</a></h3><p>There are only seven basic moves in MASKS, and a limited number of other
moves. Does that mean you can only do those things in the game? Why would
we limit it like that?</p><p>The answer is simple: the moves point to places where no one knows
what happens next.</p><p>If your superpower is flight, and you want to fly over the city, no urgency,
no rush&mldr;then there’s no uncertainty. The players and the GM all know exactly
what happens next. You just do it.</p><p>If you, someone with super strength and super speed, want to knock out a
completely mundane citizen (for some reason)&mldr;there’s no uncertainty. They
can’t hurt you, stop you, or affect you. You just do it.</p><p>If you want to throw a quick snarky insult at someone, nothing too biting or
incisive, nothing that demands a response, there’s no uncertainty. You just do it.
But when you’re trying to fly faster than Lightning Streak to make sure
you get to the Interdimensional Quantum Stabilizer first, then no one, not the
player or the GM, knows what happens. That’s when a move triggers (in this
case, unleash your powers).</p><p>When you’re trying to knock down the Stone Titan with your fists, to stop
the towering fifteen foot behemoth of stone, then no one knows what happens
next. That’s when a move triggers (in this case, directly engage a threat).
When you’re trying to throw a biting insult that makes Vanquish turn away
from the Cosmic Battery to fight you, abandoning sense and reason to smash
you into the ground for your insolence, then no one knows what happens next.
That’s when a move triggers (in this case, provoke someone).</p><p>Your character can do anything that it makes sense they can do, within the
story. Moves resolve situations in which both player and GM aren’t sure what
happens next, to tell you what happens next. They highlight the natural tension
points in a MASKS story.</p><p>When a move is triggered, everyone around the table doesn’t know what
will happen, including the GM. When a PC tries to suck all the power out of
an enormous robot and channel it directly into the city’s power grid, no one
around the table is sure what will happen until that move is resolved. And
when it’s resolved, everyone knows where the story goes next.</p><p>Sometimes, the GM and the players have to talk a bit to get on the same
page about the uncertainty. A PC wants to fly into space, and the GM feels that
it’s uncertain if they can because they’ve never done it before. But the player’s
always had it in their head that they can fly into space, should the need arise.
The player and the GM have to quickly figure out if this is truly uncertain. The
point of moves is to make us excited, interested, and surprised about what
happens next, and if someone doesn’t feel excitement around the uncertainty,
then it’s a good sign that either a move isn’t being triggered, or someone doesn’t
fully understand the situation. Talk it out and find a place where you agree
on the uncertainty, then make the move that makes sense. Or no move at all.</p><p>For more on the basic moves and when or why they’re triggered, check out
page 55.</p><h2 id=starting-the-game>STARTING THE GAME
