<p>Time for your first session! The beginning of your adventures in Halcyon City!
There will be plenty of robo dinosaurs in your future, I assure you!</p>
<p>Your first session will involve a lot of character creation. That’ll be the
players’ job. You, on the other hand, are responsible for setting up their first
adventurous forays into Halcyon City’s superhuman world.</p>
<p>Here’s what you need to do to make that first session go smoothly.</p>
<h4 id=材料和準備>

<a class=anchor href=#%e6%9d%90%e6%96%99%e5%92%8c%e6%ba%96%e5%82%99>#</a>
</h4>
<p>Print out every playbook you’re using in the game and make sure you’ve got at
least passing familiarity with each one. Limiting what you offer to the players
changes the nature of the game a bit—for example, if you want a lighter game,
don’t offer the Doomed—so think carefully about which playbooks you’re
offering.</p>
<p>Print out the other necessary sheets for the game, including a basic moves
sheet for every player. Grab some index cards or post-its, pencils, and dice. You
can find the sheets you need to print online at
<a href=http://www.magpiegames.com/masks>www.magpiegames.com/masks</a>.</p>
<p>Read through this book before you get to the table. You don’t have to
go through every inch of THE MASKS (page 93) or THE FUTURE (page 113), but
definitely skim them. HOOKS AND ARCS (page 181) is most important after your
first session, but it can give you some good things to look out for during this
first game.</p>
<p>Depending on how much time you have at the table, you might want to
prep a villain in advance. If you can make a villain at the table, connected to
the PCs and their issues, you should try to do that—but if time’s a factor, come
to the table with one ready. You can even put the villain out there and ask the
players to come up with a connection to them during character creation.</p>
<h2 id=開始第一次聚會>

<a class=anchor href=#%e9%96%8b%e5%a7%8b%e7%ac%ac%e4%b8%80%e6%ac%a1%e8%81%9a%e6%9c%83>#</a>
</h2>
<p>You’ve got your crew assembled—huzzah! Now it’s time for character creation.</p>
<p>Spread out the playbooks and give a brief overview of each. If you’ve got
the time and want to get in the mood, you can have players dramatically
read the flavor text out loud. Answer any questions that come up, and make
suggestions to players as you ask them what issues interest them. Make clear
that choosing a playbook is more about choosing the issues and themes their
character will focus on than anything else. Refer to THE HEROES (page 39) for
more information on how to create characters.</p>
<p>In particular, draw your players’ attention to the pieces of each playbook
they’re likely to skim over—their Moments of Truth and their team moves.
Those can tell them a lot about the kind of character they’re playing, so make
sure they see them up front.</p>
<p>Encourage the players to talk about their choices out loud, to build up
excitement and share input on each other’s stuff. No pressure, though—each
player can create their character through whatever process best suits them.
Once almost everyone’s done, start character introductions, going around the
table one at a time, with each player explaining who their character is, what
they look like, what they can do, and the answers to their backstory questions.</p>

</h4>
<p>Players don’t introduce their characters in a monologue. Like everything else
in MASKS, it’s a conversation; ask questions throughout. Explore their characters,
and your version of Halcyon City, with pointed questions aimed at fleshing out
their explanations.</p>
<blockquote class="book-hint info">
<p>Rich is introducing his character, Huma the Legacy, to the group (for more about
Huma’s character creation process see THE HEROES, page 40). He explains that the
greatest story of his legacy is when his dad defeated
Vortex single-handedly, after Vortex had beefed himself
up using neutron star matter.</p>
<p>“Tell me a bit more,” I say. “Why did your dad
have to fight Vortex alone? Wouldn’t other teams
have been on the scene?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but Vortex was so overpowered,
he just sucked them all into his own
personal black hole,” says Rich. “Dad
managed to knock out Vortex, then
fly in there and pull all the other
heroes out.”</p>
<p>“That’s awesome! So your
dad not only stopped the bad
guy, but saved everyone as
well!” I say. “Can you name
one or two of the heroes he
saved?” I’m trying to get the
names of a few other possible
NPCs, while also fleshing out
some of the important people in
our Halcyon City.</p>
<p>“Yeah, how about&mldr;I don’t know&mldr;let’s go with Fastball and Red Eagle,” Rich says.
“Excellent!”</p>
<p>Rich continues, saying the city widely has a positive impression of the Huma
legacy.</p>
<p>“Yeah, totally. What about other heroes, though? Folks like Fastball and Red
Eagle? Are they grateful? Jealous? Awed?” I ask.</p>
<p>“Oh, I like that it isn’t positive. Let’s go jealous, actually. They didn’t love my dad,”
Rich says.</p>
<p>“Why’s that? What did your dad do that really got their ire up, and how did you,
Huma, find out about it?”</p>
<p>“I saw an exchange between them at the house. They yelled at Dad, claiming that
he took credit for what they’d done.”</p>
<p>“Did you hear any details?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t think I did. To this day, I still kind of wonder about that.”</p>
<p>“Awesome!” I say. “Please continue!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In general, you can work with generalized answers and drill down to
specifics later—after all, it’s a classic trope of comic book fiction that characters’
full backstories only really get fleshed out over time, through flashbacks and
whatnot.</p>
<p>That said, if you feel like you need more information from their answers,
their answers are probably non-specific, based on generalities, big loaded
terms, or ambiguous details. Drill down to specifics when you feel like you
need more information. When a player says, “My dad was a criminal,” ask
“What did he do? Why did he do it?” When a player says, “The city generally
thinks I’m pretty good,” ask “Why? What did you do that earned their trust?
What does it look like, that they think you’re pretty good? Action figures?
News reports?”</p>

</h2>
<p>你在你們第一次聚會時的目標有：</p>
<ul>
<li>協助你的玩家們創建他們的角色</li>
<li>讓神翠市充滿許多的酷炫玩意兒和事件</li>
<li>展現、介紹這些角色</li>
<li>經歷這個遊戲中大部分的機制（當然還有所有的基本動作）</li>
<li>創造出你們漫畫中絕讚的第一個事件</li>
</ul>
<p>That first session, a fair amount of your time will be eaten up by character
creation. Usually, it takes about one or two hours if you’re asking questions and
exploring each character to get to your first scenes.</p>
<p>Once the characters are created, take a break and prepare a villain if you
don’t have one already (page 155). Pull in a villainous character they’ve
already set up, or create one tied into at least one PC—it’s important to have a
cool villain for an awesome opening sequence. Create a villain you’re excited
to show off!</p>
<p>Dive right in with an opening scene that’s all about a fight. Frame it
evocatively as a comic book. Describe panels that show off different parts of
the city before zooming in on your chosen location for the fight. Then show
off the villain destroying something, causing mayhem, pursuing their drive.
Finally, go to each PC one at a time, and ask them how they enter the scene,
allowing them to play up how cool they are. Maybe let them make one move,
but keep this limited—you want to get all the PCs into the scene before any of
them start doing too much.</p>
<p>Once they’re all in the scene, trigger when you enter battle against a
dangerous foe as a team (page 84) to prime the Team pool with some points
for them to use. Then go to town. Have an awesome, fun fight scene—but try
not to take up the rest of the session with it. Remember your villain’s drive:
they might try to run away if things turn against them.</p>
<p>Try to get to the aftermath of the fight, if at all possible. Shift to heroes
showing up and judging the PCs’ performance; to the PCs’ loved ones
commenting on the events of the battle; to the PCs sharing triumphant
celebrations or secrets and vulnerabilities, or comforting and supporting each
other.</p>
<p>If possible, you want your first session to hit at least the following
mechanics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every basic move, including take a powerful blow, at least once</li>
<li>Label shifts and rejecting Influence</li>
<li>Conditions, taking them and removing them</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some other key things you want to try to do in your first session:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bring on the action</li>
<li>Build on character creation</li>
<li>Ask questions constantly</li>
<li>Call out moves when they happen</li>
<li>Offer moves when the players flinch</li>
<li>Frame scenes with multiple characters</li>
<li>Shift their Labels</li>
<li>Display the adaptations to the superhuman</li>
<li>Give them a chance to talk</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=bring-on-the-action>
BRING ON THE ACTION
<a class=anchor href=#bring-on-the-action>#</a>
</h3>
<p>A huge part of MASKS is superheroic action—explosions! Punches! Flying people!
Kirby crackle! Energy bolts! Since you’re opening with a big fight against a
villain, you should have plenty of opportunity to bring on that awesome action.
Take advantage of it. Play up the tension of it, and the fun of it. Keep the pace
up early, and slow it down after the action scene is over.</p>
<h3 id=build-on-character-creation>
BUILD ON CHARACTER CREATION
<a class=anchor href=#build-on-character-creation>#</a>
</h3>
<p>The more you reincorporate elements the players have introduced during
character creation, the better. You’ve got a limited time to do it, but make
connections and incorporations as best you can. When you need to include
an endangered civilian, go for one of the NPCs introduced during character
creation. When you need to include a villain, go for someone they’ve fought
before or have a relationship with.</p>
<h3 id=ask-questions-constantly>
ASK QUESTIONS CONSTANTLY
<a class=anchor href=#ask-questions-constantly>#</a>
</h3>
<p>Never stop asking for more details throughout the whole first session. Any time
a question occurs to you about the fiction, ask it. “What happens to villains
after you paste them into the ground?” “Oh, have you ever done that with your
powers before? Did you know you could?” “Why would your mom be here,
downtown? Why wouldn’t she be running from the Blue Hydra?” Those details
give you more to play within the setting, especially when you build arcs after
the first session.</p>
<h3 id=call-out-moves-when-they-happen>
CALL OUT MOVES WHEN THEY HAPPEN
<a class=anchor href=#call-out-moves-when-they-happen>#</a>
</h3>
<p>You’re trying to show off all the basic moves, so be on the lookout for instances
when a player triggers one of them. At the very start of play, the other players
will probably need a bit more help to pick out when they’re triggering a move
or to determine which move they’re triggering. Model it early and call it out
to them, asking, “It sounds like you’re trying to _______, right?” If they want
to trigger a particular move, help them out by asking, “Cool! What does that
look like on the page?”</p>

OFFER MOVES WHEN THE PLAYERS FLINCH
<a class=anchor href=#offer-moves-when-the-players-flinch>#</a>
</h3>
<p>In general, don’t tell players what to do—leave their actions up to them. But
in this first session, offer some suggestions about moves they might make,
especially when they seem hesitant to commit. Always phrase it as a question,
based on the fiction—”Toro, you’re super strong, right? When Rampage is
pushing this bus at you, do you think you’d want to just tear through it—maybe
unleash your powers? Or maybe you want to slow her to a stop by defending
the people in the bus?”</p>
<h3 id=frame-scenes-with-multiple-characters>
FRAME SCENES WITH MULTIPLE CHARACTERS
<a class=anchor href=#frame-scenes-with-multiple-characters>#</a>
</h3>
<p>Your opening scene is definitely going to include multiple characters—the
whole team should be in that initial fight. But as the fight ends, continue to
frame scenes with at least two PCs in them, if not more. Try not to have the
PCs splinter into solo scenes. If the Protégé’s mentor berates them, do it in
front of another PC! It’s the first session, and you want to give them a chance
to interact with each other and trigger moves like defend someone or comfort
or support someone.</p>
<h3 id=shift-their-labels>
SHIFT THEIR LABELS
<a class=anchor href=#shift-their-labels>#</a>
</h3>
<p>From the get-go, use the NPCs’ Influence over the PCs to try to shift their
Labels. Have the villain tell them who they are—”You’re nothing! You can’t
possibly stand up to me!” is a classic—and then make them accept or reject
that Influence. The earlier the players get used to the idea that other characters
can change their Labels, adjusting them up or down, the better.</p>
<h3 id=display-the-adaptations-to-the-superhuman>
DISPLAY THE ADAPTATIONS TO THE SUPERHUMAN
<a class=anchor href=#display-the-adaptations-to-the-superhuman>#</a>
</h3>
<p>Show off Halcyon City’s superhuman side in this first session. Remind the
players of the past generations of superhumans with statues and monuments
around the city. Call out that people are probably used to these kinds of attacks,
so they have drills and shelters. In the aftermath, describe the expert clean-
up crews moving away rubble. Give the players a sense of place by putting
Halcyon City’s adaptations into your panels.</p>
<h3 id=give-them-a-chance-to-talk>
GIVE THEM A CHANCE TO TALK
<a class=anchor href=#give-them-a-chance-to-talk>#</a>
</h3>
<p>Alongside the need to frame scenes with multiple characters is the need
to actually let them interact with each other. Don’t try to make everything
about NPCs pushing at the PCs—let them bounce off one another. Prod
them sometimes—suggest ways they might clear conditions by messing with
each other, or suggest moves they might make in their interactions with each
other—but let them just have some time to interact directly. MASKS is about the
team, so give the heroes some time to be a team.</p>

在第一次聚會之後
<a class=anchor href=#%e5%9c%a8%e7%ac%ac%e4%b8%80%e6%ac%a1%e8%81%9a%e6%9c%83%e4%b9%8b%e5%be%8c>#</a>
</h2>
<p>When you’re done with the first session, you’ll have a good idea of who these
characters are and what they’re interested in. You’ll have plenty of NPCs to play
with, and you’ll have backstories to draw on. Let these elements percolate, and
start asking yourself questions to draw them together. You’re going to use these
pieces to build your character issues, your hooks, and your arcs—see HOOKS AND
ARCS for more (see page 181).</p>
<p>Remember that you’re not about to come up with the full plot for the next
few sessions—you’re creating the tools that will help you structure the next
sessions, but you’re always going to play to find out what happens and what
changes.</p>
