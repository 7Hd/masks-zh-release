<a class=anchor href=#%e6%88%90%e9%95%b7%e7%99%bc%e5%b1%95>#</a></h2><p>The main characters in a game of MASKS change drastically over the course of
the game. Their Labels shift, they gain and lose Influence, and they reach their
potential. All of these changes are reflected both in elements on the character
sheets and in the fiction of your game. Like the moves, change in MASKS is both
fictional and mechanical.</p><p>Sometimes you gain something in the fiction, and it causes you to mark a
change on your character playbook.</p><blockquote class="book-hint info"><p>Hornet sends the last punch into Vanquish’s jaw, knocking out the alien dictator,
while Mantis looks on. There’s no doubt in my mind—she just gained Influence over
Mantis with that impressive display, and I tell Joe to mark it down.</p><p>For his service to the strange alien Crafters, Sureshot gets a new energy bow,
something that never runs out of ammunition and can fire energy bolts of myriad
forms. I tell Mark he should probably record the new bow as a different ability with
something like energy control.</p></blockquote><p>Sometimes, you lose something in the fiction, and it makes you mark
something out of your character playbook.</p><blockquote class="book-hint info"><p>Skysong flies her crystalline ship directly into the skyscraper-sized Dominus to take
him out once and for all. The maneuver works, the energy discharge from the ship
sending him to a different dimension&mldr;but I tell Skysong to mark the ship off her
sheet. She doesn’t have it anymore—it shattered when it struck him.</p><p>Dusk learned she could take away Lady Faust’s powers while meditating in her
Penumbra sanctum, but she’d consume the power of the sanctum entirely. In the final
fight with Lady Faust, Grace decides to go through with the plan, channeling all the
power of Penumbra into Lady Faust to blast away her demonic might. I tell Grace to
cross the sanctum off her playbook.</p></blockquote><p>Reaching your potential and taking advances works in the other direction.
You take the advance mechanically, then you have to work out how it fits into
the fiction. Chances are, you and the GM will have to work together to make
sense of the change. The key, though, is that you don’t need permission to take
an advance—you can take it whenever you want, and while you might need
to work out a compromise about the fiction to make the advance make sense,
ultimately you always get whatever you take.</p><blockquote class="book-hint info"><p>Rex and the team just fought off a bunch of time-displaced dinosaurs, and Rex got an
advance thanks to a few misses during the fight. Matt really likes the idea of getting a
pet raptor, so he takes the advance Get a move from another playbook and chooses
C’mon, Lucky from the Beacon playbook. That means he gets some kind of smaller
companion that helps him out on some moves.</p><p>I think that’s awesome. I tell him that Rex finds an egg from the raptors. I suggest
that in the fiction, it probably makes sense that the egg won’t hatch a fully grown
raptor; but especially since it’s a time-displaced raptor, it probably ages rapidly as he
raises it in the team’s base, and it’ll show up at least by next session. Matt’s cool with
all that, and writes down the move and his raptor’s name.</p><p>Huma rolls a miss trying to pierce his dad’s mask, and it’s the last potential Huma
needs to advance. Rich immediately decides on Take a sanctuary from the Doomed
playbook, and suggests there’s a special place, tied to the power of Huma, that his
family never learned to call on. I think that’s awesome, so as soon as the scene is
resolved and Huma storms away from his dad, I say that his power calls him to his
new sanctuary.</p></blockquote><h3 id=marking-potential>MARKING POTENTIAL
<a class=anchor href=#marking-potential>#</a></h3><p>You have to mark potential five times to advance. As soon as you mark the
fifth, you clear your track and take an advance. Pick one option from the
advancement list and mark it off—once you’ve taken that particular advance,
you can’t take it again. Once you’ve taken five from the top list, above the line,
you can start taking options from below the line.</p><p>There are a few ways to mark potential throughout the game, ranging from
team moves to some of the results of basic moves, but the most important way
is by rolling a miss on any move. Every time you roll a miss, on any move,
you mark potential.</p><hr><h3 id=advances>ADVANCES
<a class=anchor href=#advances>#</a></h3><p>Most of the advances are pretty straightforward, but here are a few notes on what they mean.</p><div class=Move><ul><li>Take another move from your playbook</li><li>Take a move from another playbook</li></ul></div>You get another move, either from your own playbook or from a different one,
depending on which advance you choose. This is for getting another move, not
an extra—you can’t take the doom track from the Doomed, for instance, by
taking a move from another playbook.<h4 id=heading><a class=anchor href=#heading>#</a></h4><div class=Move><ul><li>Someone permanently loses Influence over you; add +1 to a Label</li></ul></div>Pick one character; they lose Influence over you if they have it, and they
can never gain Influence over you again, by any means. If they would ever gain
Influence over you, ignore that part of the move or effect.<p>After you choose that character, add +1 to any one of your Labels. Note that
this isn’t a shift, meaning that another Label doesn’t have to move down. You
simply move that Label up one. It might shift down later, like normal, but the
overall total of your Labels is permanently increased by one.</p><h4 id=heading-1><a class=anchor href=#heading-1>#</a></h4><div class=Move><ul><li>Rearrange your Labels as you choose, and add +1 to a Label</li></ul></div>As soon as you pick this advance, you can reassign the points in your
Labels however you choose, shifting any of them up and down as much as
you want, so long as the overall total of all your Labels doesn’t change. After
you’re finished shifting however you want, add +1 to a single Label. Just like
the advance above, this isn’t a shift. That Label goes up by 1, and no other Label
has to come down.<h4 id=heading-2><a class=anchor href=#heading-2>#</a></h4><div class=Move><ul><li>Unlock your Moment of Truth</li><li>Unlock your Moment of Truth after it’s been used once</li></ul></div>When you take this advance, you unlock your Moment of Truth. When you
trigger it, you follow the script listed in your playbook and take control of what
happens in the narrative (page 47). After you’ve triggered it once, it becomes
“locked” again, and you have to take the second advance to unlock it again.<p>The second advance is listed below the line, so you can only take it after
you’ve already taken five advances. Even if you change playbooks, you can
only take this advance once, after you’ve already unlocked and triggered your
playbook’s Moment of Truth.</p><h4 id=heading-3><a class=anchor href=#heading-3>#</a></h4><div class=Move><ul><li>Choose another 2 roles for The Bull’s Heart</li><li>Unlock 3 new flares</li><li>Choose up to 4 more resources from your mentor</li></ul></div>These advances get you more options for the base elements of your
playbook. When you take them, you get those additional options immediately,
selected from those already present.<h4 id=heading-4><a class=anchor href=#heading-4>#</a></h4><div class=Move><ul><li>Add +1 to any two Labels</li><li>Add +2 to the Label your mentor embodies or denies</li><li>Change your Mask Label; add +1 to your new Mask Label</li></ul></div>These advances increase your overall Label totals. Adding +1 to any two
Labels means that you increase any two Labels by one step, without shifting
anything down. Adding +2 to the Label your mentor embodies or denies is a
Protégé advance, and it requires you to add the +2 specifically to either the
Label that your mentor embodies or denies, and no others. Changing your
Mask Label and adding +1 to the new Mask Label is a Janus advance, and
represents you changing your mind about who you are, how you see yourself
and your mask.<p>Remember that each individual Label can never be higher than +3.</p><h4 id=heading-5><a class=anchor href=#heading-5>#</a></h4><div class=Move><ul><li>Take drives from the Beacon playbook</li><li>Take The Bull’s Heart from the Bull playbook</li><li>Take a sanctuary from the Doomed playbook</li><li>You adopt a human life; take secret identity and The Mask from the Janus</li><li>Take a doom, doom track, and doomsigns from the Doomed playbook</li></ul></div>These advances allow you to take a specific extra from a different playbook.
Make your choices and fill in your options as if you were building a character
of that playbook anew, unless the advance tells you to do something different.<p>For all these options, make sure you talk with the GM. Taking drives from
the Beacon might not mean much—maybe you’re just getting more interested
and excited about living a superheroic life. But if you take a sanctuary, that’s
got to come from somewhere. If you take a secret identity, you have to explain
how you can fit in with the mortal population. Work with the GM to answer
these questions after you take the advance.</p><h4 id=heading-6><a class=anchor href=#heading-6>#</a></h4><div class=Move><ul><li>Unlock the remaining two powers of your suite</li><li>Choose two new abilities from any playbook as you come into your own</li><li>Mutate further and reveal another two new abilities (chosen from any playbook)</li></ul></div>These advances give you more abilities, Remember abilities include
superpowers and skills, all the cool things that make your character deserving
of inclusion in your superhero comic book. These advances tell you what
abilities to choose from—if they tell you to choose from any playbook, then
select any abilities listed in the other playbooks.<p>The same general advice and rules from character creation apply here.
The advance is about you developing new powers and skills, and the abilities
described in the playbooks generally feed into that idea more consistently and
successfully than just picking any ability at all—for example, time travel isn’t an
ability in any of the base playbooks, and will almost always cause more trouble
than it’s worth. That said, use our own judgment, and talk to your GM and the
other players. If you have a great idea for an ability that’s not in the playbooks,
then maybe it can still work out.</p><hr><h3 id=later-advances>LATER ADVANCES
<a class=anchor href=#later-advances>#</a></h3><p>Some advances are listed in the playbook
below a line. You can only choose these
advances when you’ve already taken
five advances above the line. These are
generally uniform across the different
playbooks, but a few playbooks have some
small changes to these advances.</p><div class=Move><ul><li>Change playbooks</li></ul></div>Pick a new playbook that no other player is currently using, and switch
your character over to it. This is a huge change for your PC—they’re now
confronted with totally different issues, and their situation and life will change
to match. This is the alien Outsider settling into life on Earth and becoming a
Janus, concerned more about leading a double life than their alien home. Or
the noble Legacy being doused in strange chemicals and changing into a weird
monster, the Transformed, now contending with their grotesque body.<p>You get whatever moves the playbook tells you to take, as if you were
building a new character with that playbook. You also get whatever extras the
playbook describes. Don’t worry about the “When our team came together for
the first time…” section, or the Influence or Relationships—those things are
already set for your character. Keep your Labels exactly the same as they were
before you switched playbooks, keep any conditions you had marked, keep any
potential you have currently marked, and keep any Influence you hold over
other characters.</p><p>Use the advancement track on your new playbook, but transfer any marks
you’ve made below the line—those advances don’t “refresh” when you change
playbooks.</p><p>Whether you keep the abilities, moves, and extras of your first playbook
depends on the exact circumstances of your switch. Generally speaking, you
keep anything internal to your character—like your emotions or knowledge—
and you lose anything external that doesn’t fit with the new playbook or
would’ve been lost in the change.</p><p>If you’re the Doomed and you change to a new playbook, you almost
certainly give up your doom track and doomsigns—you’re not the Doomed
anymore, and it’s likely those pieces don’t make sense to carry over to your
new playbook. If you’re the Protégé and you change to a new playbook, you
probably give up your mentor—your story’s not about your close relationship
with them anymore. If you’re the Janus, though, you might not actually give up
your secret identity or your social obligations to become the Beacon.</p><p>It’s easy to imagine exceptions—a Protégé keeping their mentor, but
becoming part of a larger tradition as they become a Legacy, for example.
A Janus who abandons their prior life—and their prior powers—as they’re
forever altered and become the Transformed.</p><p>Talk these pieces over with your GM to decide which you keep and which
you lose, if any. The key is to be true to the fiction—what would the character
actually keep, and what would they lose?</p><h4 id=heading-7><a class=anchor href=#heading-7>#</a></h4><div class=Move><ul><li>Take an adult move</li></ul></div>When you take this advance, you immediately gain access to one of the
adult moves (page 119). Keep in mind that you can only take this advance
twice—you can only ever gain access to two of the five adult moves.<h4 id=heading-8><a class=anchor href=#heading-8>#</a></h4><div class=Move><ul><li>Lock a Label, and add +1 to a Label of your choice</li></ul></div>Pick one Label and lock it—it can’t move up nor down. If that Label would
shift, ignore that effect in its entirety.<p>You also get to add +1 to any Label you choose, remembering that this isn’t
a shift, but an addition. You can do these effects in any order, meaning you can
add +1 before you lock the Label—raising it to +3, for example, then locking it.</p><h4 id=heading-9><a class=anchor href=#heading-9>#</a></h4><div class=Move><ul><li>Retire from the life or become a paragon of the city</li></ul></div>When you take this advance, your character is no longer a PC. Regardless
of whether you choose to have them retire or become a paragon, their story,
as far as MASKS is concerned, is over.<p>If your PC retires, they stop being a superhero, at least in the traditional
sense. Maybe they go off to college, maybe they form a company around their
super science ideas, maybe they venture off into the galaxy to explore the
cosmos—regardless, they stop being a costumed superhero in Halcyon City.
What’s more, they’re guaranteed safety—the GM can’t later mess with them
specifically in any way.</p><p>If your PC becomes a paragon, they become one of the leading heroes of
Halcyon City—essentially, they become one of the adults. Even if they’re not
public, they’re still embedded deeply in the fabric of the city. Work with the
GM to figure out exactly what that looks like for the character. They transition
into an NPC, and the GM has a responsibility to avoid targeting them. They’re
presumed to be having their own adventures, conflicts, and battles, but they’re
not the focus of the story anymore.</p><p>After you choose this advance, if you’re still playing your MASKS campaign,
pick up a new playbook and make a new character.</p><h2 id=making-a-new-character>MAKING A NEW CHARACTER
<a class=anchor href=#making-a-new-character>#</a></h2><p>When you make a new character during an
ongoing campaign—most important when your old
character retires or becomes a paragon—the process
is mostly the same, aside from a few key differences.</p><p>Ignore your “When the team first came
together…” section. The team is already together, so
that question won’t matter. Instead, work out why
you’re joining the team, why the team already trusts
you, and why they want you to join their group.</p><p>Ignore your Influence section. Pick at least two PCs whose words matter to
you. Give them Influence over you.</p><p>For Relationships, fill them in with other PCs as normal.</p><p>After you’ve introduced your character, go around the table and ask each
PC if they care what you think. If they do, they give you Influence over them.
If they don’t, ask them to tell you one time they shot you down.</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div></footer><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#成長發展>成長發展</a><ul><li><a href=#marking-potential>MARKING POTENTIAL</a></li><li><a href=#advances>ADVANCES</a></li><li><a href=#later-advances>LATER ADVANCES</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#making-a-new-character>MAKING A NEW CHARACTER</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
