The main characters in a game of MASKS change drastically over the course of the game. Their Labels shift, they gain and lose Influence, and they reach their potential. All of these changes are reflected both in elements on the character sheets and in the fiction of your game. Like the moves, change in MASKS is both fictional and mechanical.
Sometimes you gain something in the fiction, and it causes you to mark a change on your character playbook.</description></item><item><title>成年英雄動作</title><link>https://hazmole.github.io/masks-zh-release/docs/rules/the-future/adult-moves/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hazmole.github.io/masks-zh-release/docs/rules/the-future/adult-moves/</guid><description>成年英雄動作
#
The adult superheroes of Halcyon City can do things the younger heroes can’t quite pull off. As the younger heroes grow in confidence, power, and ability, their capabilities mature.
Adult moves are essentially more powerful versions of the basic moves. But they don’t actually replace the basic moves—just because you can now overwhelm a vulnerable foe, that doesn’t mean you can’t directly engage a threat.
行使你的力量 WIELD YOUR POWERS

When you wield your powers with precision or grace, roll+Freak。 roll + Freak.</description></item></channel></rss>
