<a class=anchor href=#behind-the-masks>#</a></h1><p>The playbooks your players choose tell you more than just their specific
abilities and moves—they tell you the issues and themes your players are
interested in seeing during the game. That may change over the course of play;
it might turn out that the Doomed is surprisingly interested in their romantic
interest, or that the Outsider is actually interested in their dual identity. But
those playbooks flag what kind of conflicts the players want to see in the game.</p><p>As much as possible, keep in mind what moves and options they select—
those options give you further clues about what they want to see during play.
But don’t worry about this too much. Ultimately, the players are in charge of
their own characters and making their moves come into play.</p><p>Pay close attention to the contents of this section: the playbook moves.
Each playbook comes with a few GM moves, catered to that playbook’s specific
issues and elements. Use these moves when you could make any other move to
drive attention to those thematic pieces of each character.</p><h3 id=the-beacon>THE BEACON
<a class=anchor href=#the-beacon>#</a></h3><ul><li>Draw attention to their inadequacies</li><li>Praise their best traits</li><li>Make them pay for their audacity</li><li>Compare them to the others</li><li>Play to their drives</li></ul><p>The Beacon is about being the “straight man” to everybody else’s crazy, over-
the-top superhero. They’re normal, through and through, and there’s a strong
argument to be made they shouldn’t be with this team—and it’s your job, as
GM, to make that argument. Put pressure on the Beacon to prove why they
belong. Doubt them. Make them insecure. And then give them chances to
shine, doing whatever it is they do best. Pay attention to the Beacon’s drives—
those tell you what the Beacon is hoping to do, and you should try your best
to help the Beacon mark them off, at least one per session.</p><h3 id=the-bull>THE BULL
<a class=anchor href=#the-bull>#</a></h3><ul><li>Endanger their love</li><li>Bolster their rival</li><li>Reveal dark secrets of their past</li><li>Attack with someone just like them</li><li>Swarm with mundane forces</li></ul><p>The Bull is hyperfocused on their love and rival, by default. Go with that.
Play up those relationships. Make their love endangered, and their rival
bolstered, to give them chances to react. Sometimes, flip it to keep things
interesting—endanger their rival and bolster their love (maybe with a
competing love interest).</p><p>The Bull comes from some dark past, some weapons program, something
that made them so destructive. Bring that up, and don’t ever let them totally
forget what they are, especially by using villains and other enemies just like
them, or by swarming them with mundane forces to watch them prove what a
weapon they are when they overcome.</p><h3 id=the-delinquent>THE DELINQUENT
<a class=anchor href=#the-delinquent>#</a></h3><ul><li>Put them in chains</li><li>Give or take an audience</li><li>Give them conditional love</li><li>Show them the line</li><li>Offer a helping hand</li></ul><p>The Delinquent is likely to be a rebel without a cause as well as a performer
looking for an audience. They’re cynical and sarcastic, yet desirous of honest,
naïvely positive relationships. Play to all sides of their character. Restrict them
with rules so they can break free, but also offer them support and help tie them
up with relationships too.</p><p>Sometimes, put them in front of an audience of watchers who love their
antics; other times, take away that audience and leave them cold and alone.
Give them love, but only by attaching a price to it, and never let them forget
that there are powers above them setting the rules and boundaries.</p><h3 id=the-doomed>THE DOOMED
<a class=anchor href=#the-doomed>#</a></h3><ul><li>Mark their doom track</li><li>Offer a chance to further their cause</li><li>Remind them of what they could lose</li><li>Push them to the brink</li><li>Offer temporary relief with a cost</li></ul><p>The Doomed is fatalistic and grim. Adding a Doomed to your game
inherently puts death on the table, and makes your entire game a bit darker.
Don’t ever let them forget that they’re doomed. Have other characters reference
it, add bits of description about it to the fiction, and make them mark their
doom track.</p><p>Show them the best of the people around them, people who care about
them—make them want to stay here in this world. All the while, edge the
Doomed closer and closer to the brink, hitting them hard, so they have to
resort to their doomsigns and other resources for victory. Try to remember
their conditions for advancing their doom track, so you can make moves
toward those.</p><p>For the doomsign Infinite Powers , make sure they know they can take
an ability from another playbook for a one-time action—not a move from
another playbook.</p><p>Talk to them to make sure you have a joint understanding of what the
triggers that advance their doom track look like. And don’t worry about giving
them a final confrontation with their doom. If it makes sense in the fiction,
give them the opportunity to overcome it, but they’ll have to contend with their
doom, one way or another, thanks to their advances.</p><h3 id=the-janus>THE JANUS
<a class=anchor href=#the-janus>#</a></h3><ul><li>Bring their obligations to bear</li><li>Endanger someone from either life</li><li>Make their lives cross over</li><li>Put more obligations on them</li><li>Take away their mask</li></ul><p>The Janus is about the double life, the nature of having two identities. Push
them on it. You’re in charge of saying when time passes, so you’re in charge
of saying when the Janus has to roll for their social obligations—don’t skimp
on it. Continually ask them which life they’re in. If someone doesn’t know the
identity they’re currently in, ask the Janus if the Influence they hold over that
person would really apply.</p><p>Make both lives tough. Their superheroic life is obviously difficult, because
the team as a whole will be mixed up in crazy drama. But they need specific
pushing from their mundane life and the obligations therein. Have those in
their mundane life lay obligations upon them. Put the people in their mundane
life in danger as much as those in their superheroic life.</p><p>Give the people in their mundane life opinions on the people in their
superheroic life, then make them all interact. And when they’re at the mercy
of dangerous foes, or the situation warrants&mldr;unmask them.</p><h3 id=the-legacy>THE LEGACY
<a class=anchor href=#the-legacy>#</a></h3><ul><li>Remind them of their traditions</li><li>Compare them to the past</li><li>Make them answer their family’s concerns</li><li>Raise expectations on them</li><li>Honor them</li></ul><p>The Legacy is caught up in a tradition of heroism, and having one at
your table makes family important. Every PC will be compared to the older
generation to some extent, but the Legacy has direct predecessors, alongside
rules and traditions they’ve sworn to uphold. Make those prior heroes matter
more by talking about them often and having them show up at the worst
possible times.</p><p>Keep pushing on them what their legacy means, but don’t hesitate to
diversify that meaning—what it means to prior members of the legacy may
not be the same as what it means to the public, and they’ll all expect different
traditions to be upheld. Constantly compare the Legacy to their predecessors,
and use the comparisons to shift the Legacy’s Labels. Give them further duties,
obligations, and missions directly from their own legacy; if their legacy has
famous enemies, then catching or defeating those foes is a great additional
burden to saddle them with.</p><p>Sometimes, sit them down for a talk with members of their legacy to
discuss their recent performance—and don’t let them off the hook. Remember
that you’re ultimately responsible for making the move for the legacy trigger,
to see how members of the legacy respond to the PC’s recent actions; don’t let
that slide for too long.</p><h3 id=the-nova>THE NOVA
<a class=anchor href=#the-nova>#</a></h3><ul><li>Remind them of past collateral damage</li><li>Reveal a terrible truth of their powers</li><li>Make their powers flare out of control</li><li>Stoke their conditions</li><li>Introduce threats only they can tackle</li></ul><p>The Nova is pure power, and they’re likely to think they can handle nearly
any threat—what’s more, they’re probably right. But they can’t do it without
paying a high price, and that price drives the playbook. Having a Nova at your
table should amp up the power level of the threats and dangers the heroes
deal with—the Nova plays for high stakes, and they’ve made the mistakes to
prove it.</p><p>Never let the Nova forget the past damage they’ve caused. Have people
hold grudges or explain why they’re worried about the Nova’s self control.
Sometimes, cause the Nova’s powers to flare out of control, to lash out and
cause further damage.</p><p>The Nova’s heavily tied up in their own head—play with that. Show them
that their powers are truly dangerous, or come from an insidious source, or
have an inherent cost, and let them deal with that terrible truth. Play to their
conditions, their anger or their fear or their insecurity, and harp on them, while
giving them opportunities to take action to clear those conditions.</p><h3 id=the-outsider>THE OUTSIDER
<a class=anchor href=#the-outsider>#</a></h3><ul><li>Draw attention to their differences</li><li>Make a request from home</li><li>Introduce a monitor from home</li><li>Accept and support them in their moments of weakness</li><li>Provoke their beliefs and practices in tense situations</li></ul><p>The Outsider is a stranger who’s interested in fitting in. Don’t ever let them
forget the struggle. Call out how they look, act, and think differently, especially
using NPCs with Influence over the Outsider to shift their Labels. Give them
a reason to stay—show them the best parts of Earth, and accept them when
they’re low.</p><p>But provoke and prod at their beliefs, make them decide if they really want
to commit to this strange place. And never let them totally forget their home.
Even if they don’t think they have direct contact to their home, send them
missives from where they come from, making myriad requests, everything
from “Collect this” to “Come home!” Introduce characters from their home
who come to Earth for at least some time, who watch the PC and judge them.</p><p>Having an Outsider at your table means you should introduce other aliens
and cultures. Play up other outsider groups. Make Halcyon City, and the
universe, full of strange, wonderful, and terrible people.</p><h3 id=the-protégé>THE PROTÉGÉ
<a class=anchor href=#the-prot%c3%a9g%c3%a9>#</a></h3><ul><li>Convey their mistakes</li><li>Bestow wisdom, wanted or unwanted</li><li>Hold up a mirror to them</li><li>Give them exactly what they need at a cost</li><li>Endanger their mentor</li></ul><p>The Protégé is about their relationship with their mentor—so you have to
make that mentor show up a lot. The Protégé also makes past generations of
heroism matter far more than many playbooks, so be prepared to introduce
those older heroes if you’ve got a Protégé in play. But focus on the mentor—
chances are good that the mentor will have opinions of everyone on the team,
not just the Protégé.</p><p>The mentor is here to teach the Protégé, so they should always be telling
the Protégé what the PC has done wrong, and providing new advice and
knowledge. They don’t have to be mean about it, but inherently just pointing
out the Protégé’s mistakes should drive them up the wall a bit. The mentor
can provide the team with great resources and information, too—but always
at a price, most often that the team follow the mentor’s rules or suffer through
another lesson.</p><p>Make the mentor awesome, too—make them someone the Protégé might
genuinely want to be. And then show them the costs of the life that the
mentor leads, so the Protégé can see what they’re becoming. Show a mirror
to the Protégé, and ask them if they really want to be this person, or someone
different.</p><p>And sometimes, put their mentor in danger, with the only salvation coming
from the Protégé themselves. Give the Protégé the chance to show their mentor
everything they’ve learned.</p><h3 id=the-transformed>THE TRANSFORMED
<a class=anchor href=#the-transformed>#</a></h3><ul><li>Reject them</li><li>Show how they are feared or hated</li><li>Attack them with unthinking hordes</li><li>Remind them of what they’ve lost</li><li>See their true self</li></ul><p>The Transformed looks different, can’t hide it, and feels insecure about it.
They bring into play issues of being different and wanting to fit in, but from a
different perspective to the Outsider. The Outsider might be able to teach Earth
something—there might be a compromise. The Transformed, though, used to
be normal…and never will be again. The Transformed won’t find compromise
with those around them. The best they can hope for is acceptance.</p><p>Reject the Transformed and show the negative reactions their form
provokes. People fear and hate them for how they look, and their struggle is
about overcoming those perspectives; so provide plenty of rejection. Attack
them with unthinking hordes, especially from a “villagers with pitchforks”
perspective. Show them the things they’ve lost and can’t do anymore.</p><p>Sometimes, though, give them a reprieve. Don’t do it too often, but have
NPCs see through their visage to the real person beneath. Sympathize with
their pain and support them. It will make the next rejection all the more
painful.</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div></footer><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#behind-the-masks>BEHIND THE MASKS</a><ul><li><ul><li><a href=#the-beacon>THE BEACON</a></li><li><a href=#the-bull>THE BULL</a></li><li><a href=#the-delinquent>THE DELINQUENT</a></li><li><a href=#the-doomed>THE DOOMED</a></li><li><a href=#the-janus>THE JANUS</a></li><li><a href=#the-legacy>THE LEGACY</a></li><li><a href=#the-nova>THE NOVA</a></li><li><a href=#the-outsider>THE OUTSIDER</a></li><li><a href=#the-protégé>THE PROTÉGÉ</a></li><li><a href=#the-transformed>THE TRANSFORMED</a></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
