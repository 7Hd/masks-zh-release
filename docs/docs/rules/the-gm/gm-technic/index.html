<a class=anchor href=#chain-reactions>#</a></h1><p>The moves in MASKS are designed to link together. One move ends and
immediately sets up a new move. Partial hits (7-9 results) in particular push
the situation towards unresolved tension—you don’t flat out take down
Tentacular Doom, you hurt the monster instead, then it hurts you, and you
push the creature to a place where you might have a chance to knock it out
of the city, and so on. Even misses often require reaction, and that reaction
pushes towards new moves. That’s how you get tense, effective, interesting
scenes across the board—but it’s also how you get awesome fight scenes. Each
punch leads to another change in the scene, which leads to another punch.</p><p>As the GM, you control how much the moves snowball. Some things you
can say will lead to a chain reaction of moves more than others—if you capture
a PC for instance, that ends the chain reaction, whereas opening a portal that
releases alien warriors onto the streets will only push the PCs to further action.</p><p>This section details a few other things you need to know about how some
of the moves of the game connect, interrelate, and flow.</p><h2 id=fight-scenes>FIGHT SCENES
<a class=anchor href=#fight-scenes>#</a></h2><p>Fights come up often in MASKS, so you need to be prepared for them. An
awesome fight can be one of the most fun pieces of a game, but it can also
test your GMing skills. You have to manage the spotlight and the flow of the
action, the tension, the reactions of the villains&mldr;all the moving parts that make
a fight scene fun.</p><h3 id=managing-the-spotlight>MANAGING THE SPOTLIGHT
<a class=anchor href=#managing-the-spotlight>#</a></h3><p>If you have a fight scene involving every member of the team and at least one
villain, that’s a lot of characters for you to bounce between. You’re in charge
of the spotlight, i.e., which character is featured in any given panel of your
comic. In game terms, that means you’re in charge of who’s acting, who has the
chance to make a move.</p><p>When you’ve got a big fight like that, you should first see if the players have
triggered the core team move: when you enter battle against a dangerous foe
as a team. The move accounts for them being out of sync with each other and
thrown off balance, so you should only avoid the move when it’s very, very
clear they never came together as a team. This move is crucial to setting the
scene, signaling that “This is a dangerous fight!” and getting some Team in the
pool for the players.</p><p>When the punching starts, remember to be a fan of the PCs. You want to
see every one of them be awesome and amazing in your fights, and you don’t
want to see any of them neglected.</p><p>That said, stay where the action is interesting. You don’t have to give
every single character the exact same amount of time—in fact, you probably
shouldn’t. If you’re controlling what the panels of the comic book show,
you wouldn’t want the comic to flit around all the time, showing a different
character with each successive panel. You’d want to see the comic stick with a
character for a few beats before moving to the next part of the fight.</p><h3 id=crafting-tension>CRAFTING TENSION
<a class=anchor href=#crafting-tension>#</a></h3><p>How do you make fights matter? How do you make them feel tense?
Dangerous? Potentially disastrous?</p><p>First, make moves that inflict conditions or force PCs to take powerful
blows. Don’t do this out of nowhere, but if you’re following the fiction, there’ll
be ample justification for both conditions and blows. Conditions lead the
PCs to either taking interesting actions or rolling more misses, both of which
allow you to ramp up the tension. Taking a powerful blow leads to its own
interesting, stakes-raising outcomes. Rely heavily on those tools throughout
the fight.</p><p>But also make fights about more than knock-outs. Sometimes the situation
calls for a good, solid, climactic brawl, with the heroes and the villains going at
it to see who’s standing when the dust settles. And that’s awesome! But the rest
of the time, complicate the situation.</p><p>Most fights shouldn’t just be about who takes out who first, but whether the
villain can set off the Quantum Reverberator before the heroes can stop them,
or whether the heroes can get the Mayor to safety, or whether the heroes can
successfully capture the rampaging villain before they destroy too much of
the city. Make GM moves that point the fight in directions other than straight
out brawling.</p><h3 id=portraying-villains>PORTRAYING VILLAINS
<a class=anchor href=#portraying-villains>#</a></h3><p>You should still portray your villains as people, with their own character traits
and contradictions. But during fights, you need to take some steps to make
them fit the role of primary opposition.</p><p><strong>First, every time a villain marks a condition during a fight, they immediately make a condition move.</strong> They can make condition moves at
other times throughout the fight, whenever you’d make a move—but they
always make one immediately after they take the condition. These should
almost always be softer moves, setting up future action and results. Not,
“You punch Vanquish, he gets Angry, and he levels you with a punch, mark a
condition,” but “You punch Vanquish, he gets Angry, and now he’s hurtling at
you full speed with all his alien power. Stay where you’re standing and you’re
gonna get leveled. What do you do?”</p><p><strong>Second, push villains toward their drives.</strong> Drives tell you what the villains
are really after, and more often than not, they point you in directions slightly
askew from straightforward conflict. Use those drives to help keep the conflicts
interesting, and as a prompt for when villains would start to negotiate or flee.</p><p><strong>Third, follow the fiction.</strong> If the PCs nail the villain with a snide insult and
make them start feeling a particular condition, mark off that condition and
have the villain make a condition move. If the villain would be largely immune
to some kind of threat or attack from the PCs, let them know—the villain just
shrugs it off.</p><h2 id=pc-vs-pc>PC VS PC
<a class=anchor href=#pc-vs-pc>#</a></h2><p>In MASKS, there may be some conflict between PCs, situations where two young
heroes try to provoke each other or punch each other. Most of the time, PCs
try to comfort or support each other, and they have relatively little reason to
resist—even on a hit, the comforted or supported PC can choose to not open
up. But even though MASKS is mostly concerned with conflict against antagonists
and villains, sometimes the PCs will want to hit each other. That’s okay! You
and MASKS can handle it.</p><h3 id=sharing-spotlight>SHARING SPOTLIGHT
<a class=anchor href=#sharing-spotlight>#</a></h3><p>These situations ultimately follow many of the guidelines for fights. Share
the spotlight between the characters and be a fan of everyone involved. You
may flip to one PC first, as the instigator, to directly engage a threat, but you
need to keep shifting the focus of your panels so all the PCs involved get
the spotlight. No PC should ever completely thrash any other just because of
spotlight.</p><p>Remember that players usually have a fair amount of control over when
they go down. If their conditions are full and they have to mark another, then
they go out; but they have options besides marking conditions when they take
powerful blows. As such, you can rely on that move to help ensure nobody
gets taken out too quickly, too easily—the PCs may be faced with some hard choices about the costs of continuing the fight, but they probably won’t go
down without warning.</p><h3 id=defending-and-boosting>DEFENDING AND BOOSTING
<a class=anchor href=#defending-and-boosting>#</a></h3><p>The only means PCs have to directly intervene when another PC comes
after them is to defend against a PC threat. On a 7+, the defender gives the
opposition a -2 to their roll. Defend needs to be against an immediate threat,
though, and with PCs against PCs, that should really be limited to dangerous
and direct action. A PC can’t usually defend themselves when another PC tries
to comfort or support them or pierce their mask. Resolve the first move, then
let the target of the move make a move in response.</p><p>Other PCs can pretty much always help by spending Team from the pool. A
PC might scream that they don’t want help, but if another PC wants to spend
Team to help out, they get +1 to a roll. Players are encouraged to talk out of
character about whether or not they want to spend Team.</p><h3 id=player-vs-player-example>PLAYER VS PLAYER EXAMPLE
<a class=anchor href=#player-vs-player-example>#</a></h3><blockquote class="book-hint info"><p>Huma’s pretty frustrated with Vertex’s nonsense, especially choosing to let La Espada
go during their last conflict, instead of bringing her down.</p><p>“‘So what?” says Jack as Vertex. ‘You’re not the real team leader, that’s Hornet.
You’ve got no authority&mldr;unless you want to punch me. Is that what you want to do,
jerk? You gonna hit me?’ I want to provoke Huma to back down. Definitely not to
hit me!” Vertex has Influence over Huma, so that provoke definitely goes off. But
Jack gets a miss.</p><p>“Oh, yeah, okay. So Huma, I’ll turn that around. You get a free provoke on Vertex,
as if you’d rolled a 10+.” I’m turning the move around on Vertex, a great GM move
in PC vs PC conflicts.</p><p>“Awesome! I want Vertex to back down. I’d love it if he apologized, but backing
down is enough. ‘No, Vertex. I don’t have to hit you. Because you’re a coward, and
you’re going to shut up. Right. Now,’” says Rich.</p><p>“Ah, I can’t back down after that!” says Jack. He thinks for a second. “Yeah&mldr;I
guess I hit Huma!”</p><p>“Oh man,” I say. “Okay, well, first mark a condition as a result of the provoke, then
I think you’re directly engaging a threat, right?”</p><p>“Yep. I’ll mark Angry and roll to directly engage.” Jack gets an 11. “Hah! So I get
two options, right?”</p><p>“Hold on. I definitely want to defend myself,” says Rich. “I saw him coming a
mile away. I try to slip out to the side and let him run into a wall.” He rolls to defend
against an immediate threat, and gets a 9. That means he exposes himself to cost,
retribution, or judgment, but he does drop Vertex’s roll down to a 9.</p><p>“You slip to the side, Huma, but it’s not enough. Vertex’s first punch hits the wall,
but he rebounds quickly and catches you with a second blow.”</p><p>“I choose to resist or avoid his blows,” says Jack.</p><p>“Yep. So Huma, you can’t get a good shot in—you were probably a little startled
by this, despite your move to slip to the side. Vertex lands a surprisingly solid punch
to your face, but nothing too bad. Roll to take a powerful blow.”</p><p>Rich gets an 8. He debates a few options: “No way am I giving him an opportunity.
I’m tempted to lash out again, but my Superior’s not so good right now, so I’ll mark
two conditions. Angry and Insecure—I’m doubting myself. I just got punched by
Vertex.”</p><p>“Yep. Plus, you exposed yourself to cost, retribution, or judgment, right? So yeah.
Pick one of your teammates who’s watching and give them Influence over you,” I say.
“Oh, definitely Hornet! Vertex specifically mentioned her!” says Rich.</p><p>“Yep, so Hornet, you get Influence over Huma. Huma, you’ve got some nice hits
on your face—nothing too bad, but boy do they sting. And you’re keenly aware of
Hornet watching you in this fight. What do you do now?”</p><p>“I think about stopping for a minute&mldr;but I’m coming right back at him. Time
to show him what it means to be Huma. I want to directly engage and just lay him
out on the ground.”</p><p>And the fight continues…</p></blockquote><p>Don’t hesitate to let these dramatic confrontations play out—but remember,
plenty of interesting things can happen to break these fights up. If there are
other PCs there, they get the spotlight, too! They can try to interfere, defend
one teammate or the other. If someone gets a miss, they might get attacked by a
villain or interrupted by something else dangerous—that happens all the time
in comics. Use these tools to help ensure PC vs PC conflicts don’t run too long
or take up too much of your attention in the game as a whole.</p><hr><h1 id=when-youre-not-busy>WHEN YOU’RE NOT BUSY
<a class=anchor href=#when-youre-not-busy>#</a></h1><p>These tips and tricks aren’t crucial to running MASKS successfully—you’ll be fine
if you stick to the agendas, principles, and moves earlier in this chapter. But
these may give you some tools to take your game to the next level!</p><p><strong>Use splash panels.</strong> In comics, splash panels are gigantic panels, taking
up the whole page or even two pages, intricately drawn and showing off
the detailed awesome of something. When you feel like something is super
cool—some crazy heroic maneuver or some really cool fixture of the setting—
describe it in detail like a splash panel.</p><p><strong>Draw maps.</strong> They don’t have to be works of art—they just have to help you
clarify the situation. What’s where. What’s at stake. Draw them on whatever’s
available—again, don’t worry too much about quality here. The point is to
give you all the information you need to share the fictional mindscape during
complicated situations.</p><p><strong>Fill in the backstory.</strong> Ask questions about the past. Definitely the PCs’
own pasts, but the past of Halcyon City, too. Only ask questions the PCs
would actually know the answers too, but keep in mind that a huge portion of
Halcyon City’s superhuman history is public knowledge. Fill in your Halcyon
City with these answers, and build on them.</p><p><strong>Use time jumps.</strong> If things seem to be slowing down, jump forward in time,
especially between sessions. It doesn’t have to be very long—even a week or
two lets you move things to a different place, as well as trigger a few of the PCs’
moves based on the passage of time.</p><p><strong>Share the spotlight.</strong> Your comic is about the whole team, so shift between
them, especially when someone hasn’t spoken up in a while. Cut back and forth
between multiple scenes, too, to keep tension up and to give everyone some
spotlight. Make sure all the main characters in your comic get their chance to
show up in your panels.</p><p><strong>Take breaks.</strong> While playing, take breaks, especially when you’re not exactly
sure what should happen next. Take a few minutes to think about it, and come
back refreshed. Don’t hesitate to end the session at a time that feels right, even
if it’s a bit early. Don’t push yourself too hard—keep up your own interest by
giving yourself reprieves.</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div></footer><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#chain-reactions>CHAIN REACTIONS</a><ul><li><a href=#fight-scenes>FIGHT SCENES</a><ul><li><a href=#managing-the-spotlight>MANAGING THE SPOTLIGHT</a></li><li><a href=#crafting-tension>CRAFTING TENSION</a></li><li><a href=#portraying-villains>PORTRAYING VILLAINS</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#pc-vs-pc>PC VS PC</a><ul><li><a href=#sharing-spotlight>SHARING SPOTLIGHT</a></li><li><a href=#defending-and-boosting>DEFENDING AND BOOSTING</a></li><li><a href=#player-vs-player-example>PLAYER VS PLAYER EXAMPLE</a></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><a href=#when-youre-not-busy>WHEN YOU’RE NOT BUSY</a></li></ul></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
