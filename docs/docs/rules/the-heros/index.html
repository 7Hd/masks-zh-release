<a class=anchor href=#%e5%89%b5%e5%bb%ba%e8%8b%b1%e9%9b%84%e8%a7%92%e8%89%b2>#</a></h1><h2 id=選擇一個扮演書>選擇一個扮演書
<a class=anchor href=#%e9%81%b8%e6%93%87%e4%b8%80%e5%80%8b%e6%89%ae%e6%bc%94%e6%9b%b8>#</a></h2><p>The characters you create for MASKS are the protagonists of the story, the stars
of your comic book. To ensure an interesting cast of characters, MASKS uses
playbooks, each one a basic skeleton for a kind of character from young
superhero stories. There are ten core playbooks in this book: The Beacon, The
Bull, The Delinquent, The Doomed, The Janus, The Legacy, The Nova, The
Outsider, The Protégé, and The Transformed. You can also find limited edition
and fan-created playbooks elsewhere.</p><p>Each player (except the GM) chooses a single playbook at the start of
play and uses it to create their character. No two players can pick the same
playbook; because MASKS focuses on the team dynamics of these young heroes,
the members of the team need to be disparate and distinct. If two players want
the same playbook, the GM can suggest similar alternatives, or resolve the issue
with a coin flip or dice roll.</p><p>The playbooks don’t tell you exactly who you’re playing; they give you an
interesting starting point for designing differentiated characters who play to the
themes and issues of MASKS. Each playbook has a series of issues, complications,
and themes wrapped up in its particulars, and it’s important that you’re happy
with whatever you choose. For more on the individual playbooks and their
particular stories, see page 93.</p><h3 id=我該怎麼創建我最喜歡的角色>我該怎麼創建我最喜歡的角色？
<a class=anchor href=#%e6%88%91%e8%a9%b2%e6%80%8e%e9%ba%bc%e5%89%b5%e5%bb%ba%e6%88%91%e6%9c%80%e5%96%9c%e6%ad%a1%e7%9a%84%e8%a7%92%e8%89%b2>#</a></h3><p>If you approach the playbooks saying, “I want to play my favorite character
from comics. How do I do that?” they might seem too restrictive. But each
playbook is more open than it might look at a glance. They give you boundaries
for your sandbox, or a skeleton to build your character on top of. The specifics
are largely left up to your own interpretation and choices in the fiction.</p><p>The playbooks are flexible: the Nova playbook is about power and how
you manage it—but that doesn’t mean the Nova must be a particular kind
of character with a particular kind of powers. They might be a mutant with
extraordinary psychic powers; a cosmic entity embodied in human form with
powers over the fundamental forces of the universe; or a young witch on track
to become the most powerful sorceress in the entire multiverse.</p><p>The playbooks are primarily about the kind of story the character is
involved with, the dramatic issues they’re likely to face. If you have an idea
for a particular kind of character, talk with your GM and your group to see if
it makes sense for the playbook—chances are, there’s a way to make it work.</p><h3 id=拼湊出神翠市的樣貌>拼湊出神翠市的樣貌
<a class=anchor href=#%e6%8b%bc%e6%b9%8a%e5%87%ba%e7%a5%9e%e7%bf%a0%e5%b8%82%e7%9a%84%e6%a8%a3%e8%b2%8c>#</a></h3><p>The openness of the playbooks means you have to fill in some blanks as you
make characters. If your Nova is a sorceress, then you need to speak to the role
of sorcery in Halcyon City; if they’re a mutant, then you have to answer some
questions about how mutants fit in.</p><p>That’s all good! The rules ensure that your characters work, that you can
tell dramatic stories about them. And the basics on Halcyon City (page 9)
should give you enough of a framework to start answering these questions. But
after that, it’s down to you. You make your own particular version of Halcyon
City by filling in the specifics and details as you go. And because MASKS and
Halcyon City are about the kind of kaleidoscopic comic book craziness that
includes nearly anything you can think of, there’s pretty much no way you can
go wrong, provided everyone in the group thinks the direction you’re taking
the city is fun.</p><blockquote class="book-hint info">Rich is creating his character, so first he needs
to pick his playbook. He’s sort of interested
in playing a classic character, someone with
powers, but nothing too bizarre. He’s thinking
about a super strong, super tough guy. He
narrows it down to the Bull, the Legacy,
or the Transformed. The
Transformed is more bizarre
than what he’s looking for,
and the Bull sounds a little
too gruff or ignoble, so he
settles on the Legacy. He
especially likes the idea of
being the latest in a line of
classic characters, which
is the Legacy’s core issue.</blockquote><h2 id=名稱和外貌>名稱和外貌
<a class=anchor href=#%e5%90%8d%e7%a8%b1%e5%92%8c%e5%a4%96%e8%b2%8c>#</a></h2><p>You’ve got your playbook! Next you pick your name and your look. These give you a starting point for thinking about your character.</p><p>You need to pick your hero name, and you might have to or want to pick your real name, if it’s different from your hero name. For some characters, the two might be the same—if you’re a modern incarnation of the Greek god Athena, and you’re never really an ordinary person, there’s no need to choose a different “real name.” Other characters, though, have a clear dividing line between their costumed heroic identity and their real identity—you might play a regular kid named Maria Moreno, who puts on a costume to become Darkwolf.</p><p>There are examples of real names and possible superhero-style names on the GM sheets, but ultimately it’s your choice—in superhero stories, the best names are the ones you find the most compelling.</p><p>Think about your look, how you physically appear to others—how you present yourself, what you regularly wear, and so on. Choose as many from each list as apply. You might also choose some options differentiating how you look in your heroic persona and how you look the rest of the time.</p><blockquote class="book-hint info"><p>Rich next picks the name and look for his Legacy. He decides his character is a
man, Middle Eastern—Iranian, in particular. He pictures a handsome young man,
born in America but of Iranian descent. He picks “trendy clothing” next; he thinks
his character dresses pretty well when wearing civilian outfits. Then, “predecessor’s
costume”—his character wears the same basic costume as his predecessor, so
something iconic and relatively classic, with bold colors and lines. Probably spandex-
ish. Off the top of his head, he’s thinking red and white.</p><p>Finally, he picks his character’s names. After a bit of research, he picks Rustam
Attar for his character’s real name. Then, for his character’s superhero name, he picks
Huma, the name of a mythical Iranian bird.</p></blockquote><h2 id=超能力>超能力
<a class=anchor href=#%e8%b6%85%e8%83%bd%e5%8a%9b>#</a></h2><p>Now pick your abilities. Abilities is a broad term, meant to indicate the special
things your character can do that puts them into the superheroic world. Some
abilities are the height of standard human capabilities—Olympic-level athletics,
for instance. Others are straight up incredible superhuman abilities, like
controlling fire or reading minds. Choose as many abilities as your playbooks
says from the available list. Some playbooks have special instructions for
abilities, such as the Bull or the Protégé. Simply follow those instructions.</p><p>Your abilities leave some information up to interpretation. A Nova might
have sorcery, but that doesn’t tell you exactly what sorcery looks like, how it
works, or what you can do with it. An Outsider might have radical shapeshifting,
but that doesn’t say exactly how they change shape, or what they can change
shape into—just that it’s radical, probably changing their whole body into totally
different shapes, not just changing their face. In two different games, a player
could create a Legacy with the same exact abilities as in the other game—super
strength, invincibility, and flight—but they can look completely different, with
one of them being simply an invulnerable and god-like humanoid, and the
other wearing a powerful suit of protective mechanized armor.</p><p>Abilities don’t clearly state exactly what you can or can’t do: after all, if your
ability is super speed, that doesn’t tell you at all whether you can travel at 600
miles per hour, or break the sound barrier, or vibrate your molecules through
a wall. Abilities give you a clearer picture of your character at the start of play
and a jumping off point for figuring out what makes sense for your character’s
specific capabilities. For example, someone whose abilities are martial arts and
swords probably can’t run at 600 miles per hour, break the sound barrier, or
vibrate their molecules through a wall. Yet.</p><p>You’ll discover the specifics of your abilities through play at your table,
through discussions with the GM, and through your own decisions. After all,
you’re playing to find out!</p><blockquote class="book-hint info"><p>Huma is a Legacy, so he chooses his abilities a little differently than other playbooks.
To fill in Huma’s abilities, Rich first picks one line on the playbook, then picks two
abilities from that line that he doesn’t have yet. He settles on a line that fits those
pretty classic powers he wanted—super strength, invincibility, eye beams, flight, and
super senses. He picks eye beams and super senses as the powers he doesn’t have.
That means Huma does have super strength, invincibility, and flight.</p><p>Rich considers that these might take a surprising form—maybe he grows actual
wings to fly or glows with fire when he’s using his super strength—but ultimately,
he settles on pretty classic manifestations. He’s ridiculously strong, his body’s pretty
much impervious to harm, and he can fly, leaving a trail of gold behind him. Classic.</p></blockquote><h3 id=but-what-about-that-one-power>BUT WHAT ABOUT THAT ONE POWER?
<a class=anchor href=#but-what-about-that-one-power>#</a></h3><p>You may notice that not every possible power is represented, especially not for
every playbook. You may wish that a particular power was listed, or that it was
left open-ended so you could fill in whatever power you want.</p><p>Here’s the thing. I guarantee that the abilities listed for each playbook will
work well in play. They’ll give you exactly the kind of springboard you need
to make interesting characters, while still giving you an idea of what your
character can do, and ultimately playing into the particular issues and themes
of each playbook.</p><p>Within those abilities, there’s still plenty of wiggle room to define them how
you want. The Bull, for example, is superhumanly tough, incredibly strong, and
uniquely skilled at fighting. That could mean that the Bull can turn to metal at
will, or it could mean that the Bull has a ridiculous healing factor, or it could
mean that the Bull can grow to enormous size—any of those descriptions fits
the general categories of “tough, strong, and skilled at fighting.” Take advantage
of that wiggle room to make your abilities what you want them to be.</p><p>After that, if you still don’t want to pick one of the listed abilities, or you’d
rather pick something else you’ve come up with—you can do that! I won’t be
at your table ready to swat you with a ruler if you don’t play exactly according
to the playbook as written. But…I can’t guarantee other abilities will work as
well—some abilities might even outright contradict the point of some of the
playbooks. For example, playing a Bull with an open-ended and incredibly
useful power like telekinesis could change what the Bull is about, making
them more like a Nova than a Bull. Playing a Beacon with real, useful, genuine
superpowers totally undermines the point of that playbook, and playing an
Outsider without strange or particularly alien powers takes away some of the
dramatic oomph of that playbook.</p><p>So if you want to use other abilities than those listed, go ahead—it’s
ultimately your game and your table. It still might work just fine, and you still
might have a great time. But using the abilities listed in the playbooks is your
best bet to make MASKS work for you.</p><h2 id=標籤屬性>標籤屬性
<a class=anchor href=#%e6%a8%99%e7%b1%a4%e5%b1%ac%e6%80%a7>#</a></h2><p>In MASKS, you have five main stats called Labels. Each Label tells you how your
character understands their self-image. These Labels shift and change over the
course of play as your character’s own self-image changes, and those changes
are often in direct reaction to how others see you. When you’re a young hero,
how you see yourself is determined just as much by others as it is by your own
choices, for better or worse.</p><p>The five Labels are:</p><p>Danger: seeing yourself as threatening, strong, bloody-knuckled, and risky.
Other people see you as a danger when they think they should steer clear of
you because you might bring them harm. You see yourself as a danger when
you believe you can take down other dangerous threats, and when you think
you yourself are a threat to other people.</p><p>Freak: seeing yourself as strange, unusual, unique, and powerful. Other
people see you as a freak when they think you’re odd, unlike them, something
unnatural or outside of their understanding. You see yourself as a freak when
you accept and own the things you can do that no one else can, and when you
think you don’t belong with the people and the world around you.</p><p>Savior: seeing yourself as defending, guarding, protecting, and stalwart.
Other people see you as a savior when they think of you as noble or self-
sacrificing, or a bit overbearing and moralizing. You see yourself as a savior
when you think of yourself as a martyr, someone who gladly sacrifices to
protect and defend others.</p><p>Superior: seeing yourself as smart, capable, crafty, and quick. Other people
see you as superior when they think you’re the smartest person in the room,
an arrogant and egotistical jerk. You see yourself as superior when you think
you’re cleverer than everyone else, and when you know exactly what to say to
make the people around you do what you want.</p><p>Mundane: seeing yourself as normal, human, empathetic, and
understanding. Other people see you as mundane when they think of you as
all too normal and uninteresting, but also comprehending and sympathetic.
You see yourself as mundane when you think you’re regular, just a person,
not special, and focused on normal human things like feelings and emotions.</p><h3 id=rules-for-labels>RULES FOR LABELS
<a class=anchor href=#rules-for-labels>#</a></h3><p>Every playbook comes with a predetermined set of values for your Labels. You
can add +1 to any one Label of your choice, making sure it doesn’t go over
+3. You might want to look at the basic moves and your playbook moves to
determine what Label you want to add +1 to, but you can also do it just based
on your character’s self-image.</p><p>On your playbook, record your starting Labels by circling the appropriate
numbers on each line. Do this in pencil; your Labels will change a lot!</p><p>A couple important rules for your Labels:</p><ul><li><p>The vast majority of the time, when one Label shifts up, another shifts down, and vice versa. There might be a few cases when this isn’t true, but if rules reference shifting Labels without further explanation, this is what they mean: one goes up, and another goes down.</p></li><li><p>If a Label would shift up past +3, or down past -2, then no shift at all occurs—neither of the two Labels that would change goes up or down. Instead, you mark a condition—a negative emotional state that starts affecting your actions. If you see yourself as too much of an extreme, hen it starts messing you up.</p></li></ul><blockquote class="book-hint info">According to the Legacy playbook, Huma’s starting Labels are Freak +0, Danger -1,
Savior +2, Superior +0, and Mundane +1. So at the start of play, Huma sees himself
mostly as someone who saves other people, partly as someone normal and human,
and actively not as a threat to anyone. Rich decides to add his free +1 to Superior; he
thinks Huma is pretty smart, but also maybe a bit arrogant and haughty.</blockquote><h2 id=狀態>狀態
<a class=anchor href=#%e7%8b%80%e6%85%8b>#</a></h2><p>You don’t have any decisions to make here, but understanding conditions
might affect your choices on some of your moves. All PCs have the same five
conditions to mark: Afraid, Angry, Guilty, Hopeless, and Insecure. Sometimes
you have to mark conditions during the game as a result of moves and misses.
While you have a condition marked, you take -2 ongoing to particular basic
moves, depending on which condition it is. If you have multiple conditions
marked, all are applicable. There are a few ways to clear conditions, and you
can find out more about them on page 88.</p><h2 id=背景故事>背景故事
<a class=anchor href=#%e8%83%8c%e6%99%af%e6%95%85%e4%ba%8b>#</a></h2><p>Each set of backstory questions is a series of prompts to get you thinking
about your character’s identity, how they relate to Halcyon City and its
superhuman side, and how they relate to other people. Try to jot down a
few answers to these questions so you can bring them up during character
introductions. When other characters are brought up in these questions, focus
on NPCs and avoid using other PCs to answer the questions.</p><p>For the moment, skip the “When Our Team First Came Together,” “Relationships” and “Influence” sections.</p><blockquote class="book-hint info"><p>Rich jots down a few answers to Huma’s backstory questions.</p><ul><li>When did you officially become a part of your legacy?
On my 16th birthday, Dad actually awoke the
powers within me and gave me the title.</li><li>What’s the best story you always heard about your legacy?
The time that Huma single-handedly defeated Vortex after he’d
grown the black hole in his chest with neutron star matter.</li><li>How does the public perceive your legacy?
Pretty positively. Huma’s a classic and noble hero,
adopted by Halcyon City when the family moved here.</li><li>How does your legacy tie into your reasons for being a hero?
It’s pretty much the whole reason. I was never going to
be anything else, I never really thought about it.</li><li>Why do you care about the team?
Because Huma is all about being an icon to others,
and I can be a good role model for them.</li></ul></blockquote><h2 id=挑選扮演書動作>挑選扮演書動作
<a class=anchor href=#%e6%8c%91%e9%81%b8%e6%89%ae%e6%bc%94%e6%9b%b8%e5%8b%95%e4%bd%9c>#</a></h2><p>At the start of play, any character can trigger the basic moves, including
directly engage a threat, unleash your powers, defend someone, assess
the situation, provoke someone, comfort or support someone, and pierce
someone’s mask. Each of these moves triggers when the characters take action
in the fiction that match the move.</p><p>In addition to the basic moves, every character gets some playbook
moves that may grant them wholly new abilities or may build on the basic
moves. Some of them require their own rolls, while others change the way the
basic moves work or add new abilities that work without a roll.</p><p>Each playbook has its own rules for how many and which playbook moves
you can take at the start of play. Follow those rules. If you want to change
where you put the +1 in your Labels to match up with playbook moves you
like, go right ahead—you haven’t started playing yet. But keep in mind your
Labels will change, so any such connection is liable to be temporary.</p><p>Many of the playbooks also have extras. These aren’t moves; while they
may follow the move structure, they’re special additional pieces that define the
different playbooks and make them more distinct and interesting. For example,
the Doomed playbook has their doom track and doomsigns, and the Janus
playbook has their mundane life. Make any necessary decisions about your
extras as you go through your playbook.</p><p>Over the course of play, you may be able to take moves from other
playbooks. There’s space for you to write those in. Keep in mind that taking
another playbook move doesn’t mean you can take another playbook’s extra.
You have to switch playbooks to get access to a Legacy’s lineage or the Nova’s
flares (with a few exceptions built into the advancement lists).</p><blockquote class="book-hint info">Rich looks at his Moves section and sees that he gets two of the listed options. He
chooses Words of the past and Fight the good fight. He needs to fill in at least
two names in his legacy section for the members of his legacy. He chooses his dad,
Shahin Attar, as retired and judgmental, and Demonsoul as the greatest opposition
his legacy has ever faced. As the GM, I start thinking about ways to bring those NPCs
into play right away!</blockquote><h2 id=關鍵時刻>關鍵時刻
<a class=anchor href=#%e9%97%9c%e9%8d%b5%e6%99%82%e5%88%bb>#</a></h2><p>You don’t have any decisions to make about your playbook’s Moment of Truth,
but it’s good to familiarize yourself with it early. Your Moment of Truth
is a script for a special instant when you get to seize control of the game’s
conversation. Each playbook’s is a bit different, and gives you an idea for the
kinds of thing you’re allowed to say when you trigger your Moment of Truth.</p><p>You’re not mind-controlling anybody, so you probably can’t say what the other
PCs or NPCs choose to do—but you can say largely everything else, including
how you defeat them or how you change the world around you. It’s a moment
when the spotlight’s on your character, and we’re all interested in seeing them
be awesome—which means you get to say what happens in a much more direct
fashion than at any other time in the game.</p><p>You can’t trigger your Moment of Truth until you’ve unlocked it
through advancement (page 115). Then, you can trigger it whenever you
want, and during that scene you have full control of describing
what your character does, for as long as you remain within
your playbook’s script. After your Moment of Truth is over,
you permanently lock one of your Labels—it will never
change again (page 118).</p><p>Your Moment of Truth tells you a lot about the key,
critical moment for your playbook—what it looks
like when everything comes to a head, and your
character shows off the fullest extent of what
they can do.</p><blockquote class="book-hint info">Rich briefly looks at his Moment of
Truth. It’s about coming fully into
his powers and upholding the
full weight of his legacy, so
Rich gets a clear notion
that Huma’s story
will be about the
pressure and
burden of that
name.</blockquote><h2 id=團隊動作>團隊動作
<a class=anchor href=#%e5%9c%98%e9%9a%8a%e5%8b%95%e4%bd%9c>#</a></h2><p>Every character gets two team moves, one that triggers when they share a
triumphant celebration with someone, and one that triggers when they share
a vulnerability or weakness with someone. You don’t have any decisions to
make here, but read through the team moves for your playbook to get an idea
of your playbook’s issues and how they relate to other characters at critical,
dramatic moments.</p><blockquote class="book-hint info">Rich looks over his two team moves. The triumphant celebration move deals with
how superior the Legacy views himself, and the vulnerability move concerns the
secrets of his legacy. He’s getting an idea that Huma’s dramatic arc will deal with
where he fits in with the team—and that his legacy must have secrets to fit his
vulnerability move.</blockquote><h2 id=自我介紹>自我介紹
<a class=anchor href=#%e8%87%aa%e6%88%91%e4%bb%8b%e7%b4%b9>#</a></h2><p>Once everyone finishes filling out most of their playbooks (everything except
for their “When Our Team First Came Together” section, their Relationships,
and their Influence section), then it’s time for character introductions.</p><p>One at a time, each player takes a few minutes to share their name, their
look, their abilities, the answer to their backstory questions, and anything else
important that the other characters might know about them. During this time,
the other players and the GM especially can and should ask them questions to
get a better grasp on who the character is.</p><blockquote class="book-hint info">Rich introduces Huma, explaining his look, his abilities, and a few facts, such as
Huma is the latest in a line of Humas, his dad is retired, and his mundane identity
isn’t public. I, the GM, ask a few questions to fill in more information, like how long
Huma’s been in Halcyon City.</blockquote><h3 id=當團隊初次集結時>「當團隊初次集結時……」
<a class=anchor href=#%e7%95%b6%e5%9c%98%e9%9a%8a%e5%88%9d%e6%ac%a1%e9%9b%86%e7%b5%90%e6%99%82>#</a></h3><p>After introductions, determine the inciting incident that made this team of
young superheroes come together in the first place. It was something big,
something that none of them could tackle on their own, something that
required them to work together against far greater odds, something that forged
them into a group greater than the sum of its parts. When you actually start
playing, you’ll tell a story set some time after this inciting incident—the team’s
been together for a while at this point. This process just makes sure everybody’s
on the same page for how it all started.</p><p>Each playbook has its own statement and question. One by one, each
player reads their “When our team first came together…” question out loud,
so everyone knows what questions are on the table. Then, the GM leads the
group in a discussion about those questions and their answers, filling in the
details of what happened when the team first came together.</p><p>Each player has total control over the answers to their playbook’s question.
They can ask for input and ideas from the other playbooks, but they have final
say. Each succeeding question should build on and take into account what
came before.</p><p>The questions should be answered in a particular order to ensure that the
answers build on each other and you aren’t trying to figure out the details
before you’ve covered the fundamentals. The discussion can cover whatever
ground comes up, but it’s the GM’s job to pointedly ask the players to answer
their questions in the order provided on the GM sheet.</p><p>If a particular playbook isn’t in play, then its question doesn’t need to be
answered. The GM can still choose to ask the question of the group, in which
case the answer comes from group consensus or from whatever player the GM
chooses to ask.</p><p>The group as a whole and the GM in particular should ask additional
questions as necessary to fill in the details on this incident, until everybody
has a pretty clear picture of what happened and who was involved. At the end
of this process, you should have a good idea of the incident that drew the group
together, their very first adventure, and the roles that the PCs played in it.</p><blockquote class="book-hint info"><p>When it’s time to fill in Huma’s question, the group has already filled in a lot of
information. They know that they fought a ridiculous, over the top enemy named
Technosaurus Rex, right in the center of town, where they inadvertently blew up a
monument to Flying Freedom. They know that they saved the life of Mayor Eveline
Clearwater, and to win the fight they had to tear open a hole in time and space and
push Technosaurus Rex through—totally against the rules of the older heroes and
of A.E.G.I.S.</p><p>Now, it’s time for the Legacy’s question. Rich reads it aloud: “All things considered,
we did well and impressed an established hero. Who was it?”</p><p>Marissa suggests that it could be the leader of the New Exemplars, the leading
superhero team in the city, but Jack points out that would undercut how much
they’ve angered the older heroes with their time-hole strategy. Rich agrees. Instead,
he suggests they impressed someone else, a quieter hero, someone who works more
behind the scenes—the Everyman, a shapechanger who can appear as any person
and never appears in the same form twice. The rest of the players like it, so Rich goes
with that.</p><p>I ask, “So why was he impressed?”</p><p>Rich replies, “We did what was necessary, and we didn’t hesitate, even though we
were breaking the rules. That’s something Everyman endorses.”</p><p>I nod, and we move on the next question.</p></blockquote><h2 id=人際關係>人際關係
<a class=anchor href=#%e4%ba%ba%e9%9a%9b%e9%97%9c%e4%bf%82>#</a></h2><p>Once you know the details of the incident that brought the team together,
fill out each character’s relationships with the others. Each playbook has
two relationships on it, sentences with blanks in them. One at a time, each
player reads one sentence from their playbook, and fills in the name of a fellow
teammate. This sets an initial relationship between those two characters.</p><blockquote class="book-hint info">When it’s his turn, Rich chooses his first relationship to fill in.
“I think I once got caught breaking my legacy’s rules with Toro,” he says.
“Oh, neat!” I say. “So, what were you doing?”
“I think my legacy has pretty clear rules when it comes to putting up a positive
image, y’know? Nothing formal, but Dad always said I had to be on my best behavior
whenever anybody might be watching. But I wanted to impress her, so I tried to use
my superhero name to get us into a club, and&mldr;it didn’t go so hot. Plus, Dad heard
about it, and chewed me out.”
“Perfect! Toro, were you actually impressed?”
“Not really? I mean, he didn’t get us in. But it was cute that he tried,” says Marissa.
The group does a few more relationships, then it’s Huma’s turn again.
“For my second relationship, I think that I trust Hornet, and told her an
important secret of my legacy. I feel like Hornet’s the one I can trust to take me
down if I ever get out of control,” Rich says.
“Awesome! What was the secret?” I ask.
“How to take away my powers. There are these feathers, supposedly taken from
an actual huma, and as long as you’ve got one on you, my powers can’t affect you. If
you put it on me, my powers go away entirely,” Rich says. Before this moment, none
of that was true&mldr;but now it is.
“Excellent! And did you give Hornet one of these feathers?”
“No, I just told her about them,” Rich says.
“Hornet, did you do any more digging about the feathers afterward?”
“Definitely,” says Joe. “I think I know where one is, at the museum, if it turns out
I need one.”</blockquote><p>Feel free to discuss these relationships as you go. Ultimately, each player has
final say over whose name they put into each blank, but they should feel free
to ask for suggestions or ideas.</p><h2 id=影響力>影響力
<a class=anchor href=#%e5%bd%b1%e9%9f%bf%e5%8a%9b>#</a></h2><p>Finally, each character gives out some Influence to their teammates. Influence
in MASKS is a binary resource—someone either has it over you, or they don’t. If
someone has Influence over you, it means you care about what they think, say,
or do about you. It means their words carry weight with you, and can change
how you see yourself. By default, in MASKS, all adults hold Influence over the PCs.
This section of character creation is about sharing Influence among teammates.</p><p>Each playbook has a section that describes how much Influence they give
out to their teammates. Sometimes you have to make a choice about your
initial demeanor, how you come off to the others first thing—other times it just
tells you how many characters you give Influence to. Choose which teammates
you give Influence to, and hand them one of your Influence tokens to mark it.</p><p>You can always choose to give out more Influence—if you think your
character cares about somebody’s words, then you should give them Influence
over you if they don’t already have it. But you have to at least give out as much
as your playbook tells you to.</p><p>When handing out Influence, think about whose words your character
most cares about at the moment, who’s most likely to be able to change how
they see their self. Influence comes and goes over the course of play, so don’t
worry too much about this initial set-up.</p><blockquote class="book-hint info"><p>When it’s time for Huma to hand out Influence, Rich follows what it says in the
Legacy playbook:</p><p>“You’re a part of this team, for better or worse, and you care what they think.
Give Influence to all of your teammates,” Rich reads aloud. He then hands one of his
Influence tokens to every other PC. Huma cares about what they all think.</p></blockquote><p>Once all the PCs have handed each other Influence according to their
playbooks, then you’re ready to play!</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div></footer><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><div class=book-toc-content><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#創建英雄角色>創建英雄角色</a><ul><li><a href=#選擇一個扮演書>選擇一個扮演書</a><ul><li><a href=#我該怎麼創建我最喜歡的角色>我該怎麼創建我最喜歡的角色？</a></li><li><a href=#拼湊出神翠市的樣貌>拼湊出神翠市的樣貌</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#名稱和外貌>名稱和外貌</a></li><li><a href=#超能力>超能力</a><ul><li><a href=#but-what-about-that-one-power>BUT WHAT ABOUT THAT ONE POWER?</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#標籤屬性>標籤屬性</a><ul><li><a href=#rules-for-labels>RULES FOR LABELS</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#狀態>狀態</a></li><li><a href=#背景故事>背景故事</a></li><li><a href=#挑選扮演書動作>挑選扮演書動作</a></li><li><a href=#關鍵時刻>關鍵時刻</a></li><li><a href=#團隊動作>團隊動作</a></li><li><a href=#自我介紹>自我介紹</a><ul><li><a href=#當團隊初次集結時>「當團隊初次集結時……」</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#人際關係>人際關係</a></li><li><a href=#影響力>影響力</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div></aside></main></body></html>
