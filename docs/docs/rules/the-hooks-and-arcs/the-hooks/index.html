BUILDING HOOKS
<a class=anchor href=#building-hooks>#</a>
</h2>
<p>Each hook is an actual character that pulls a PC towards a Label. Pairs of hooks
are always focused on one PC, in particular on the two Labels by which they
might be defined. The simplest way to come up with a pair of hooks for a PC
is to ask: “Is (PC) a (Label) or (Label)?”</p>
<p>Think of this question as if you’re a reader of your game’s comic book
series. Where do you think the main characters are going? How do you think
others see them? What do you think is pushing them to take action? Setting
up hooks flags these issues and ideas so you can emphasize them during play.</p>
<p>Build some hooks after your first session of play, and always look at them
between sessions. If you feel that a given pair of hooks has been resolved—
especially if the PC has locked any of the Labels involved in the pair—then
you should create a new pair of hooks for that PC. In general, hold onto a pair
of hooks for about three or four sessions before changing up the conflict and
focusing on a new set of Labels.</p>
<p>When you build a new pair of hooks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose the PC that they’re centered on</li>
<li>Choose the Labels involved</li>
<li>Assign NPCs to the pairings</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=choosing-the-pc>
CHOOSING THE PC
<a class=anchor href=#choosing-the-pc>#</a>
</h3>
<p>Ultimately, you need at least one pair of hooks for each PC so you have
something to guide you on how to pull each PC’s self-image. When you’re
choosing which PC to build a new pair of hooks for, though, only choose PCs
who either don’t have hooks yet or who’ve resolved their last pair of hooks.</p>
<p>When you pick the PC, take a look at their Labels, who has Influence over
them, whom they have Influence over, and anything else of note about their
character.</p>
<h3 id=choose-the-labels>
CHOOSE THE LABELS
<a class=anchor href=#choose-the-labels>#</a>
</h3>
<p>Each pair of Labels charts a different kind of conflict, a different set of issues.
The pairing of Danger vs Savior, for example, is about the tension between
destructively defeating enemies and saving lives; the pairing of Danger vs
Freak, on the other hand, is about the fine line between appearing strange and
powerful, and appearing to be a genuine threat.</p>
<p>Each Label in a hook comes with an impulse that tells you a general
direction and drive that hook uses to push the PC toward that Label. For
example, a Freak hook might feature an impulse of “To isolate and drive
away,” and a Mundane hook might feature an impulse of “To make normal.”
When you use those hooks, look for ways to have the Freak hook drive the
PC into isolation, making them feel different and separate and alone, while
the Mundane hook offers normalcy, both by making them feel normal and by
telling them to hide their strangeness and act “normal.”</p>
<div class=Move>
<h4 id=pairing-danger-vs-freak>
PAIRING: DANGER VS FREAK
<a class=anchor href=#pairing-danger-vs-freak>#</a>
</h4>
<p>This pairing is about power—especially when it gets out of hand. PCs involved
in a Danger vs Freak pairing are often the most powerful of their team, capable
of rewriting existence or causing massive destruction. Those around them
question whether they can be trusted with their power—maybe because they’re
kids or because they have more power than anybody should be trusted with.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hook Impulse — Danger: To remind them of collateral damage</li>
<li>Hook Impulse — Freak: To play up their strangeness and capabilities</li>
</ul>
</div><div class=Move>
<h4 id=pairing-danger-vs-mundane>
PAIRING: DANGER VS MUNDANE
<a class=anchor href=#pairing-danger-vs-mundane>#</a>
</h4>
<p>This pairing is about fear. PCs involved in a Danger vs Mundane pairing are
viewed with understanding by those close to them, and fear by others—until
things go wrong, and the fear may spread like wildfire. But can they show those
who fear them that they’re just a person at heart? Or will they turn out to be
the threat everyone worries can’t be stopped?</p>
<p>• Hook Impulse — Danger: To mistrust and provoke
• Hook Impulse — Mundane: To interrupt dangerous situations</p>
</div><div class=Move>
<h4 id=pairing-danger-vs-savior>
PAIRING: DANGER VS SAVIOR
<a class=anchor href=#pairing-danger-vs-savior>#</a>
</h4>
<p>This pairing is about heroic roles. PCs involved in a Danger vs Savior pairing
are torn between defeating enemies and saving lives. When they’re caught in a
dangerous fight, they’re not sure if they should take down the villain fast and
hard or if they should focus on keeping people safe at the cost of potentially
letting the villain escape.</p>
<p>• Hook Impulse — Danger: To push towards a fight
• Hook Impulse — Savior: To push away from a straight fight, towards saving lives</p>
</div><div class=Move>
<h4 id=pairing-danger-vs-superior>
PAIRING: DANGER VS SUPERIOR
<a class=anchor href=#pairing-danger-vs-superior>#</a>
</h4>
<p>This pairing is about control. Superior characters are good at looking around,
taking in the environment, understanding it, using it&mldr;and provoking other
people to do what they want. Surgical strikes and efforts. Dangerous characters
are good at punching enemies in the face, at letting loose, at breaking things
down. Characters caught in these arcs are stuck between precision and
uncontrolled venting.</p>
<p>• Hook Impulse — Danger: To infuriate and provoke
• Hook Impulse — Superior: To point out failures of control and planning</p>
</div><div class=Move>
<h4 id=pairing-freak-vs-mundane>
PAIRING: FREAK VS MUNDANE
<a class=anchor href=#pairing-freak-vs-mundane>#</a>
</h4>
<p>This pairing is about fitting in, usually focusing on one of two angles: either
the PC is especially strange, notably different from the people around them,
and unsure if they’ll ever fit in&mldr;or they’re especially normal, and they don’t
feel different enough. Either way, the people involved in this pairing push them
either further in sync with the normal people of Halcyon City, or push them
to be alone, separate from the people around them by their own strangeness.</p>
<p>• Hook Impulse — Freak: To isolate and drive away
• Hook Impulse — Mundane: To make normal</p>
</div><div class=Move>
<h4 id=pairing-freak-vs-superior>
PAIRING: FREAK VS SUPERIOR
<a class=anchor href=#pairing-freak-vs-superior>#</a>
</h4>
<p>This pairing is about being special. A character who is caught in this pairing
hears voices on one side telling them they’re better, stronger, and more capable
than everyone around them, and voices on the other side calling them a
worthless monster. Either way, they’re struggling to make sense of what their
difference means.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hook Impulse — Freak: To call out the flaws of strangeness</li>
<li>Hook Impulse — Superior: To praise the power and ability of strangeness</li>
</ul>
</div><div class=Move>
<h4 id=pairing-freak-vs-savior>
PAIRING: FREAK VS SAVIOR
<a class=anchor href=#pairing-freak-vs-savior>#</a>
</h4>
<p>This pairing is about responsibility. What responsibilities does someone with
intense power have? Are they beholden only to their own power? Or are they
burdened with the need to make use of their powers for the greater good?</p>
<p>• Hook Impulse — Freak: To praise immense power and abilities
• Hook Impulse — Savior: To place responsibility</p>
</div><div class=Move>
<h4 id=pairing-mundane-vs-superior>
PAIRING: MUNDANE VS SUPERIOR
<a class=anchor href=#pairing-mundane-vs-superior>#</a>
</h4>
<p>This pairing is about human connection. Characters with a high Mundane
can connect with other people on a meaningful level&mldr;but they can’t get those
people to reliably do what they want. Characters with a high Superior, on
the other hand, can manipulate other people and their environment much
more directly, but they’re more aloof and detached from those people. With
this pairing, play up that detachment, the cost of feeling superior and the
compromises required of being mundane.</p>
<p>• Hook Impulse — Mundane: To require compromise for connection
• Hook Impulse — Superior: To detach and distance from others</p>
</div><div class=Move>
<h4 id=pairing-mundane-vs-savior>
PAIRING: MUNDANE VS SAVIOR
<a class=anchor href=#pairing-mundane-vs-savior>#</a>
</h4>
<p>This pairing is about saving others—protecting them from outward and inner
threats. Saviors are great at stopping a car flying through the air at someone’s
face, but Mundane characters can actually make people feel better, and might
even be able to save villains from themselves.</p>
<p>• Hook Impulse — Mundane: To ask for empathy and mercy
• Hook Impulse — Savior: To demand defense and protection for
innocents</p>
</div><div class=Move>
<h4 id=pairing-savior-vs-superior>
PAIRING: SAVIOR VS SUPERIOR
<a class=anchor href=#pairing-savior-vs-superior>#</a>
</h4>
<p>This pairing is about whether heroes should be proactive or reactive. Saviors
respond to threats&mldr;but superior PCs read the situation and manipulate those
around them to take action. They solve problems proactively, at the cost of
being coldly removed from those around them. Which method is truly heroic?
Fighting the good fight or winning the war?</p>
<p>• Hook Impulse — Savior: To highlight impending threats
• Hook Impulse — Superior: To present opportunities for action</p>
</div>
<h3 id=assign-npcs>
ASSIGN NPCs
<a class=anchor href=#assign-npcs>#</a>
</h3>
<p>After selecting the pairing for your hooks, assign the
hooks themselves to either side of the pairing. A hook
is a fictional element embodying the pull on the PC
in the direction of a particular Label. It’s the Janus’s
mother, pulling the Janus to be more and more
Mundane. It’s the Protégé’s mentor, pulling the
Protégé to be more and more Superior.</p>
<p>Hooks should almost always be characters. If
you feel very strongly that a location or item could
pull the PC in a particular direction, then use
it as a hook, but try to stick to characters.
They can be villains, or they can be friends, or
family members, or anyone, so long as they’d
pull the PC in one direction of the pairing.</p>
<p>Whenever you can, use the same NPCs
across multiple pairings. That way, you
instantly generate PC-NPC-PC triangles.
When the Protégé’s mentor wants
the Protégé to be more
of a Savior, but
continuously
tells the
Transformed
they’re a Danger, there’s
instant tension, even between those two PCs.
Reusing the NPCs keeps your game tight and
focused on that particular set of characters.</p>
<p>If necessary, you can make up a new
character to use as a hook for a pairing, but try
to use characters that are already in your game, even if they’re
only mentioned on someone’s character sheet when you’re
filling in your hooks.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id=how-to-use-hooks>
HOW TO USE HOOKS
<a class=anchor href=#how-to-use-hooks>#</a>
</h2>
<p>Set up your hooks between sessions. Doing so makes you think about who
these characters are, and ask yourself questions about what they might become.
During play, use your list of hooks as a reference sheet for your moves.</p>
<p>When you’re at a loss for the next scene, bring the characters together with
their hooks, and pull them towards the Labels involved. Set scenes using the
hooks, and push their Labels hard. If you need to make a hard move, have one
of the hooks take Influence on the PC and shift their Labels.</p>
<p>Use your list of hooks to remind you of the character’s big, primary issue,
as well. NPCs not even directly involved in the pairing can still poke and push
and pull at those Labels. When you aren’t sure which Label to shift, think about
the pairings and the hooks, and try to angle for those Labels.</p>
<p>At the end of every session, ask yourself if it’s still an open question whether
the PC is one Label or the other. Does the player think it’s resolved? Do you? If
so, then change that pairing to a new one. If not, then keep that pairing steady,
and think about other ways to pull on those Labels with those hooks.</p>

<h2 id=sample-hook-pairing>
SAMPLE HOOK PAIRING
<a class=anchor href=#sample-hook-pairing>#</a>
</h2>
<blockquote class="book-hint info">
<p>I’m brainstorming a pair of hooks for Rex, the Transformed. Rex so far has been
pretty surly; he’s clearly distraught about his transformed body. He has a high Freak
and an especially low Mundane&mldr;but he also saved Skysong, and he’s been acting
more like a Savior, especially with her around. I know I can’t make Skysong a hook—
she’s a PC—but I’m thinking about the questions for Rex: maybe “Is he a Freak or a
Savior?” or “Is he a Danger or a Freak?”</p>
<p>Ultimately, I settle on “Is he a Freak or Mundane?” It fits his Labels as they sit
right now, and I can more easily think of hooks for the pairing. For Freak, it’s clearly
Samuel Searley, the television pundit who loves to talk about how terrifying Rex looks.
I’ll need to tweak what Searley says a bit moving forward to focus more on Freak
than Danger, but it’s an easy fix. For Mundane, I’m thinking about Grasshopper’s little
sister, Ciara. Rex met Ciara when he saved her from Carlo the Assassin—and I think
it’s interesting to have Ciara treat Rex like a normal person. We haven’t seen them
together on screen yet, but I like reincorporating the same character, and creating a
