<a class=anchor href=#what-is-masks>#</a></h2><p>Ever imagine what it’d be like to punch down walls? Throw lightning from
your fingertips? Run faster than the human eye can see? Fly?</p><p>Ever been told “No” by a parent, teacher, boss, someone above you, maybe
even someone you looked up to? Ever wanted to tell them, “I don’t care what
you say,” as you go do something completely awesome?</p><p>Ever read stories about interesting, cool, complicated heroes, people
uncertain of who they are, uncertain of what they should do, but ultimately
striving to do the right thing in the face of impossible odds? And triumphing?</p><p>MASKS is where all those experiences connect. A game where you get to
tell your own awesome superhero comic book stories about young people
standing up to the world around them and paving their own way—with plenty
of explosions and madness along the way. A game where you get to both guide
the story and be surprised to find out where it’s going.</p><p>When you play MASKS, you and your friends tell a story, almost as if you’re
writing a comic together, each of you taking on the roles of the main characters
in the story. Actual play is like a conversation, with you and your friends
talking about those characters, what they do, and what happens. You’re each
co-authors and readers; you get to guide where the story goes, and you get to
be excited when it goes somewhere you never expected.</p><p>Unlike a regular comic book, MASKS has rules that take you places you didn’t
expect, keep things exciting and surprising, and guide you through what to
say and when. So when you fling a car at the T-rex, instead of just saying what
happens, the rules jump in and help fill in the next step. You have to contribute
some, too—these rules offer guidelines that you and your group use to tell a
story—but they’ll point you down certain paths, ones you might not’ve chosen.
But that’s the entire point!</p><p>If you want to tell a story where you know exactly what will happen, you
can write it on your own. MASKS lets you play to find out what happens. When
you throw that car, you won’t know in advance whether the T-rex will snatch it
out of the air with terrifying jaws, or shoot it with secret cyber-dinosaur missile
launchers, or just get decked across the face. You roll them dice and see what
ensues, and get the enjoyment of being surprised.</p><h2 id=tales-to-astonish>Tales to Astonish!
<a class=anchor href=#tales-to-astonish>#</a></h2><p>In addition to the story itself, the plot, the things that happen, MASKS is about
awesome, over-the-top superheroic shenanigans. And that kind of superhero
stuff is just damn fun. Ridiculous? Sure. A bit stupid from time to time? Yeah,
totally. But damn fun? Without a doubt. What other stories give you time
travelers, sorcerers, mutants, aliens, and some guy with a bow all on the same
team? What other stories give you world-ending stakes coupled with all-too-
personal drama, because it turns out the apocalyptic mutant demon from
another world didn’t just possess some random guy, it possessed your brother?
Sure, superhero stuff can get a little silly, but it’s damn fun if you go with it.
Yeah, teen drama can get a little overwrought, but it’ll get you right in your
feels if you let it. Embrace it!</p><p>MASKS is first and foremost about a team of young superheroes. They’re
friends, rivals, love interests, allies…and always teammates, joint stars of their
comic, and superheroes. They’re young; they’ve got abilities that make them
special; they wear costumes; they use codenames; they save people; and they
do it together. They’re growing up in Halcyon City, a place with plenty of older
supers who provide an endless clamor of voices telling them who to be, and
these young heroes are all trying to figure out their own way.</p><p>All of those pieces are key. You might have awesome story ideas about the
premiere team of superheroes, or a crazy group of misfits on a spaceship, or
genetic superhumans fighting to protect a world that hates or fears them—but
MASKS, as it’s presented in this book, isn’t written for those stories. You’ll find
pieces of those tales, but the core of this game is different.</p><p>If you’re here because you love stories about young
adults, where everything feels heightened, like
it matters more…If you’re here because you
love stories about growing up, the transition
from something smaller and self-focused
to something new and interesting and
capable of changing the world…If you’re
here because you’re excited about a game
exploring identity and self-image in the
face of others’ influence…Or if you’re
here because you love superhero stories,
punching aliens, making dramatic speeches,
and saving the world&mldr;</p><p>Then, good. You’re in the right place.</p><h2 id=halcyon-city>HALCYON CITY
<a class=anchor href=#halcyon-city>#</a></h2><p>There’s no place like it, anywhere else on earth. And to those who call it home,
there’s no place better.</p><p>Halcyon City is a massive, bustling megalopolis. Gleaming silver
skyscrapers adorn its business districts, and assorted streets, bridges, and rails
crisscross its body. Countless people from countless cultures and walks of life
populate this great city. It’s a contradictory and wonderful combination of
darkness, crime, corruption, and flaws, built on the errors of the past alongside
light, hope, and the promise of change and growth. It’s always been the city of
tomorrow and yesterday, and that’s never been more true than today.</p><p>Halcyon is the focal point of the super-powered, extra-normal world.
Caped figures soar through its skies and break into fights against terrible
monsters and gigantic robots. Villains scheme in nefarious lairs hidden in the
clouds over the city, while heroes meet and contemplate their next course of
action in their golden halls of justice. Paranormal adventurers walk Halcyon
City’s streets, looking for distortions and portals to other realms, while time
travelers and aliens make this city their home, for better or worse.</p><p>The city’s always had more than its share of strange heroes and goings-on,
but since the late 1930s, it’s played home to more superhumans and their kin
than any other place on Earth, and the city has evolved to fit its population.
Construction crews work at ridiculous speeds to repair the damage done in
superhuman brawls. Law enforcement has adapted to the superhuman activity
with a unique set of responses and equipment. Halcyon hosts the headquarters
of A.E.G.I.S., the Advanced Expert Group for Intervention and Security, an
elite government agency that arose specifically to deal with superhumans,
among other weird, secret, and superhuman oriented organizations.</p><p>Over the course of 80 or so years of superheroes, Halcyon City has
seen three relatively distinct generations of superheroes rise and fall. These
three generations are known colloquially as the Gold Generation, the Silver
Generation, and the Bronze Generation. And now&mldr;there’s a new generation
rising. The children of other superheroes, or trainees of prior generations, or
brand new superpowered individuals, all trying to figure out who they are in
the midst of Halcyon City’s own special brand of wonder and insanity.</p><p>That’s you. You’re the new generation, and soon enough, this city with its
amazing miracles and impossible wonders will be yours. Who will you be when
it’s time to inherit Halcyon’s reins? What will you make of the place? Whose
butts will you kick on the way?</p><h2 id=finding-yourself>FINDING YOURSELF
<a class=anchor href=#finding-yourself>#</a></h2><p>So there you are. You’ve got your cape. You’ve got your superpowers. You’ve
got a cool name you spent a while thinking about. You’ve even got a team of
friends. And you’re in the greatest city on earth.</p><p>What now? Where do you go? Who will you become?</p><p>In MASKS, you play characters who are approximately 16 to 20 years old
(with allowances made for stuff like the alien who’s actually 1,000 years old
and is still a teenager in mind and body). They’re trying to figure out who they
are, but they’re not so young as to have no idea at all. The trouble is all these
adults around them, telling them what to do and who to be. Everybody has a
vested interest in making these young heroes one thing or another—from their
parents, who might just want them to be normal and safe and human, to their
mentors who want them to be noble and heroic and upright, to their enemies
who want them to be dangerous or free or arrogant.</p><p>It’s the story we all face as we grow up. We don’t just become exactly what
our parents, teachers, or mentors want us to be&mldr;and we don’t completely
abandon or ignore what they say, either, whether we want to or not.</p><p>MASKS is all about that story. It’s about seeing these young superheroes go
through the wringer, get thrown into crazy superhero fights, get pushed and
changed by the words and ideas of those around them, and then at the end,
seeing who they’ve become. Sometimes, they’ll be heroes. Sometimes, they’ll
be monsters. Either way? It’ll be an awesome ride.</p><h2 id=playing-to-find-out>PLAYING TO FIND OUT
<a class=anchor href=#playing-to-find-out>#</a></h2><p>There may be times while playing MASKS when you say, “Oh! I know exactly
what happens next!” You feel like you have the best possible idea for a stream
of events to take your character to some interesting place, and you just want
to say what those are.</p><p>Don’t.</p><p>The characters in MASKS don’t really know where they belong, where they’ll
end up, who they’ll become, and you don’t either. This is a story of uncertainty
and discovery. Don’t cheat yourself out of that excitement by planning the next
dramatic arc in detail. Don’t force a rivalry or romance or convince yourself
that your character needs to die in the next fight. Just let it happen.</p><p>The mechanics in MASKS will push you in new and different directions, taking
you places you wouldn’t have expected. It’ll take some discipline to really
adhere to those mechanics and go where they’re taking you, but it’s worth it. So
much of the fun of MASKS lies in the surprise of finding out what happens, who
the characters are becoming, without knowing in advance. Commit yourself
to that uncertainty—you’ll be glad you did.</p><h2 id=where-this-came-from>WHERE THIS CAME FROM
<a class=anchor href=#where-this-came-from>#</a></h2><p>MASKS borrows its rules framework, and many ideas about stories and
storytelling, from the game APOCALYPSE WORLD by D. Vincent Baker. APOCALYPSE WORLD
is a mature game (think R rating) about the post-apocalyptic wasteland. MASKS
is pretty different in terms of subject matter and style, but the basic spine of
both games is the same: both are about playing to discover, about dynamic
characters changing in reaction to each other and the world around them,
about stories that go to places you’d never expect.</p><p>You don’t need APOCALYPSE WORLD to play MASKS; everything you need to play
this game is included in this book. But if you want to take a look at APOCALYPSE
WORLD (and you’re comfortable with its mature content level), then it’s well
worth your time.</p><p>MASKS also comes from a long tradition of young superhero stories. Here’re a
few worth checking out to get an idea of the style and themes of MASKS:</p><ul><li>少年正義聯盟 Young Justice (卡通電視影集 by Brandon Vietti & Greg Weisman)</li><li>少年復仇者 Young Avengers (第一冊 by Allan Heinberg & Jim Cheung, 以及 第二冊 by Kieron Gillen & James McKelvie)</li><li>復仇者學院 Avengers Academy (by Christos Gage & Mike McKone)</li><li>離家童盟 Runaways (by Brian K. Vaughn & Adrian Alphona)</li><li>少年悍將 Teen Titans (原創卡通網路影集, 以及 漫畫 by Marv Wolfman 和Geoff Johns 發行的版本)</li><li>驚奇女士 Ms. Marvel (by G. Willow Wilson & Adrian Alphona)</li><li>金鋼狼與X戰警 Wolverine and the X-Men (by Jason Aaron & Chris Bachalo)</li></ul><h2 id=what-youll-need>WHAT YOU’LL NEED
<a class=anchor href=#what-youll-need>#</a></h2><p>To play MASKS, you need a few friends willing to commit to playing at least one
2 to 4 hour session. A single session of MASKS is fun, but the game really sings
when you play multiple linked sessions.</p><p>MASKS needs one player to be the Gamemaster or GM—that’s a special role
with responsibilities slightly different from the other players, see THE GM page
125 for more—and 3 to 5 players to play the main characters of the game, the
Player Characters or PCs.</p><p>You also need some additional supplies. Usually the GM brings a lot of
these resources, but just make sure someone is bringing them. Having this book
at the table in some form is pretty useful, too.</p><h3 id=dice>DICE
<a class=anchor href=#dice>#</a></h3><p>You need at least two six-sided dice, like the kind you find in Monopoly or
Risk. One pair is enough to play, but it’s a lot better to have one pair of dice
for each player.</p><h3 id=playbooks>PLAYBOOKS
<a class=anchor href=#playbooks>#</a></h3><p>You need a printed copy of each of the ten core playbooks. Each one can be
printed, landscape, on regular letter paper. You can add in a few limited edition
playbooks or take out a few core playbooks to adjust the mix, but make sure
you’ve got a wide variety printed and ready.</p><h3 id=pencils-and-paper>PENCILS AND PAPER
<a class=anchor href=#pencils-and-paper>#</a></h3><p>You’ll want plenty of pencils, at least one for each player—throughout the game,
the players mark up and make changes to their character sheets, so they need
pencils for sure. You’ll also want plenty of scrap paper, either notebooks or index
cards or post-its, so you can write down names and notes throughout the game.</p><h3 id=additional-materials>ADDITIONAL MATERIALS
<a class=anchor href=#additional-materials>#</a></h3><p>Some other materials you’ll need or want:</p><ul><li>Tokens for Influence, at least one set of about 5 distinct tokens for each player (the Hero Deck has cards that act as tokens, if you have it)</li><li>Some inspirational art and pictures, to generate ideas (the Deck of Villainy has a pantheon of villains, for example)</li><li>Printed copies of the basic moves, one for each player</li></ul><p>A printed copy of the GM materials You can find the sheets for running a game of MASKS as downloads, and more
information on the Hero Deck and the Deck of Villainy, at www.magpiegames.

<span>...</span></div><input type=checkbox class=hidden><div class="book-expand-content markdown-inner"><p>The name of the game is MASKS. There’s a rules piece in the game called pierce
the mask. The chapter including the playbooks is called THE MASKS. Why such an
emphasis on masks?</p><p>On one level, the game is about superheroes—and the association of masks with
those costumed superpeople is pretty well ingrained, thanks to nearly a century of
such stories.</p><p>But on another level, the game is about appearances, image, and perception. It’s
about the conflict between what you seem to be, and what you actually are.
Everybody wears masks. Everyone’s fitting into some kind of image or mold,
playing some kind of role. Everyone has a “mask” to pierce, even if they’re not
wearing anything on their face. The playbooks you choose, the appearances of your
characters, their secret identities and their superhero names—all masks, of one
form or another.</p><p>Embrace masks. Revel in putting them on, taking them off, trying on new ones,
